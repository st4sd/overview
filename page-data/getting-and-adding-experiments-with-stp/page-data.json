Through the\ninterface, users can browse available experiments, view their details, logs, and\nthe results of their runs. Additionally, users can download experiments by\nscrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking the \"Download JSON\" button.\nHowever, there may be instances where they want to perform this action\nprogrammatically. With `stp` this is trivial: let us imagine we want to download\nthe\n[nanopore-geometry-experiment](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment)\nthat is available on our public registry.\n\nWe can simply run:\n\n```commandline\nstp package download https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment\n```\n\nFor the experiment JSON to be downloaded to our currently active directory.\n\n## Pushing PVEPs\n\nWe need to add experiments to our Registry instance before we can view or run\nthem. To do this, we can either create a local PVEP definition from scratch or\ndownload it from another instance (e.g., by using the `stp package download`\ncommand). Once we have the definition, we can use `stp` to push it to our\nregistry.\n\nAssuming our local file is called `nanopore-geometry-experiment.json` and is in\nour current directory, we can run:\n\n```commandline\nstp package push nanopore-geometry-experiment.json\n```\n\nAnd `stp` will add it to our active context (you can learn more on contexts\n[here](/stp#working-with-contexts)).\n\n## Importing PVEPs\n\nIn the previous sections, we learned how to download PVEPs and add them to our\nRegistry instance using the `download` and `push` commands. These commands are\nversatile and can be used in various scenarios. However, if our goal is simply\nto download a PVEP from an external instance and add it to our own, `stp` offers\nanother command, `import`, that can accomplish this task efficiently.\n\nSimply run:\n\n```commandline\nstp package import https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"1271ca03f43008369901293ac6499691","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":224},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting and adding experiments with stp"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Getting and adding experiments with stp\n---\n\n<!--\n\n  Copyright IBM Inc.
