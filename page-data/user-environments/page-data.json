Assuming the virtual environment you created when setting up the local client is activated you can start the server by executing the following in a terminal\n\n```\njupyter-notebook\n```\n\nThis will start Jupyter server and open the server webpage in your default browser.\n\nAt this point follow the [login instructions](#login) as above.\n\n## Local Terminal with OpenShift ST4SD Instance\n\nYou can also interact with OpenShift ST4SD instance via the terminal.
