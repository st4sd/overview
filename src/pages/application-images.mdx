ST4SD virtual experiment developers can use application images to provide functionality for steps in their workflows.

Images provided by the ST4SD team are hosted on quay.io at the following address: https://quay.io/organization/st4sd.
These images focus on simulation applications and include quantum chemistry simulation codes, molecular dynamics codes, and containerized versions of useful scientific packages. 

Depending on their prefixes, the images on quay.io will fall into one of the three following categories:
- `community-applications`: ST4SD **community** applications
- `contributed-applications`: ST4SD **contributed** applications
- `official-base`: ST4SD **official** applications

## ST4SD community applications

These images are made available by the ST4SD community.

- **Criteria**: These application images can be provided _as is_.
                The only requirement for them is to follow a naming convention (e.g. `${application}-${maintainer id}:${version}`).
- **Push access**: Permission to push images to the community registry is available to anyone who wants to contribute.
                   See [How can I contribute my application image to the ST4SD registries?](#how-can-i-contribute-my-application-image-to-the-st4sd-registries) for details.
- **Maintainers**: The contributors of these application images are expected to be the image maintainers.

## ST4SD contributed applications

These images are donated by the ST4SD community and follow a more rigorous set of standards.

- **Criteria**: As a minimum, of contributed applications should conform to the following requirements:
    - Follow a naming convention (e.g. `${application}-${maintainer id}:${version}`).
    - Be stable
    - Use unique tags with version information
    - Run as non-root and follow [OpenShift best practices for building containers](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/openshift_images/create-images.html)
- **Push Access**: Permission to push images that conform to "most" requirements is available to anyone who wants to contribute.
                   See [How can I contribute my application image to the ST4SD registries?](#how-can-i-contribute-my-application-image-to-the-st4sd-registries) for details.
- **Maintainers**: The contributors of these application images are expected to be the image maintainers.

## ST4SD official applications

These images are maintained directly by the ST4SD development team.

- **Criteria**: The application images should:
    - Follow a naming convention (e.g. `${application}-${maintainer id}:${version}`).
    - Be stable
    - Be size optimised
    - Use unique tags with version information
    - Run as non-root and follow [OpenShift best practices for building containers](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/openshift_images/create-images.html)
    - Be multi-architecture (recommended)
- **Push Access**: ST4SD development team.
- **Maintainers**: ST4SD development team.

## How can I contribute my application image to the ST4SD registries?

ST4SD  welcomes contributions. To proceed: 

1. Make a request for including your application images to the _community_ or _contributed_ applications by following the instructions in [Contribute](/contribute). 
2. The ST4SD maintainers will help you finding the most suitable category for your application image. If it is named correctly it can always be added to the _community_ applications.
3. After this you will receive push permissions to the appropriate repository where you will be able to maintain and update your image.
