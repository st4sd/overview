## Contributing to the Community

There are two main ways to contribute to the community - with [**images**](/application-images/) and with **virtual experiments**. We are currently creating contribution guidelines for **virtual experiments** but in the meantime you can still engage with us to make them available.

### Application Images

If you have an application image e.g. for a simulation program, you want to make available we can add it to our [quay.io organization](https://quay.io/organization/st4sd) so others in the community can see it and access it. You can find more information about the guidelines for this process [here](/application-images/). When you are ready to begin contributing images, click on the **Contribute an image** card above to start this process.

### Virtual Experiments

If you have a virtual experiment that you would like to advertise we can add it to the [ST4SD Global Registry](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/) page. This way, others in the community will be able to see it and access it. Click on the **Contribute a virtual experiment** card above to start this process.


## Contributing to Core

If you want to add new features to any ST4SD component follow this process

- Read [overview](https://github.com/st4sd/overview) to get general sense of how components fit together
- [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) of the ST4SD component you want to contribute to
- When done open a PR for your for fork
