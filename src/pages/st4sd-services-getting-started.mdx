**ST4SD Services** provides capabilities for creating and controlling virtual experiments via a RESTapi and for capturing and storing the resulting data.
It is built on enterprise-grade database and industry-standard RESTapi technology.
Any researcher comfortable with programming can start using ST4SD Services.

## Why ST4SD Services ?

<div className="expressive-content-list-group">
  <ExpressiveList
    title="APIs to launch and control virtual experiments"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<AppDeveloper />}>

Create, run, and monitor the progress of, experiments from e.g. Jupyter Notebooks using our python or REST APIs.

  </ExpressiveList>


  <ExpressiveList
    title="Perform complex queries and retrieve results"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<Construct />}>

Our python Datastore API enables executing powerful queries over 1000s of virtual-experiment executions and retrieving any data produced by them.

  </ExpressiveList>

  <ExpressiveList
    title="Memoization"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<AcceleratedComputing />}>

ST4SD Services enables reusing results of previous calculations rather than executing them again, a feature called Memoization
This can significantly improve the execution time of your experiments.

## Try it yourself

If you have access to an ST4SD Cloud instance `pip install "st4sd-runtime-core[develop]>=2.5.0"` then execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples/
cd st4sd-examples
jupyter-notebook main/ST4SD\ Runtime\ API\ Example.ipynb
```

Follow the notebooks instructions to access your `ST4SD Cloud` instance and try the APIs.
Also try the `ST4SD\ Datastore\ Common\ Query\ Examples.ipynb` notebook in the same folder for examples of retrieving the metadata, files, and logs that experiments generate.

  <ExpressiveList
    title="Use the APIs"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<ServerOperatingSystems />}>

[Learn](/running-workflows-on-openshift) how to use the ST4SD python client API to run, query, and interact with virtual experiments.
The APIs also offer access to a trove of experiment metadata and files such as logs and outputs.
You can find more examples in our Jupyter Notebooks [example repository](https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples).

  <ExpressiveList
    title="Get outputs using experiment interfaces"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<NaturalLanguageUnderstanding />}>

Virtual Experiments may optionally implement an [interface](/writing-a-virtual-experiment-interface) to record the measurements that the experiment generates for the inputs it processes.
Learn how to use virtual experiment interfaces [here](/using-a-virtual-experiment-interface).

  </ExpressiveList>

  <ExpressiveList
    title="Speedup your experiments through memoization"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<AcceleratedComputing />}>

Switching on the [memoization feature](/memoization) configures your experiments to automatically reuse results of previous calculations rather than executing them again.
