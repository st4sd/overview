When ST4SD is deployed on the cloud (e.g. OpenShift) it comes with a number of microservices that users can access via Jupyter notebooks and the `stp` command line interface.

Install ST4SD on the cloud to unlock a number of features, such as:

- a Web UI interface to view, parameterise, and generate virtual experiments in your registry
- replacing sub-graphs of your virtual experiments with other sub-graphs (e.g. surrogate models)
- a Datastore to retrieve metadata about your virtual experiments and logs and files that experiments produce

and many more!
