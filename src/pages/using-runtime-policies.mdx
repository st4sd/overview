## What is a runtime policy?

Runtime policies are algorithms which modify the default behaviour of ST4SD when its asked to run a parameterised package.


## How to use a runtime policy?

You can use a runtime policy by configuring the `runtimePolicy` field of the `api_experiment_start()` [payload](/running-workflows-on-openshift#running-a-virtual-experiment).

### Example

```python
from __future__ import typing
import json
def experiment_start(api: experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI) -> str:
    """Start an experiment that uses the prefer-surrogate runtime policy

    Arguments:
      api: An instance of ExperimentRestAPI that has connected to your
           private ST4SD registry

    Notes:

      The method expects that you have already created the homo-lumo-dft-gamess-us
      parameterised package on your ST4SD registry and have synthesized (or imported)
      a surrogate parameterised package that can substitute homo-lumo-dft-gamess-us.

    Returns:
        The UID of the resulting instance
    """

    payload = {
        "inputs": [
            {"filename": "input_smiles.csv", "content": "label,smiles\nmy_molecule,CCC"}
        ],
        "runtimePolicy": {
          "name": "prefer-surrogate"
        }
    }

    return api.api_experiment_start(
        # the identifier of the parameterised virtual experiment package
        "homo-lumo-dft-gamess-us",
        payload)
```

## Policy: prefer-surrogate

The algorithm of the policy is:

1. Find a suitable surrogate package of the requested parameterised package in the `api_experiment_start()` payload
   1. Find parameterised packages that are the result of synthesizing a [transformation relationship](/using-graph-relationships#automatically-synthesize-new-parameterised-packages), AND
   2. The [outputGraph](/using-graph-relationships#structure-of-a-relationship) of the associated `transformation relationship` matches a subGraph of the requested parameterised package.
1. If there is a suitable surrogate parameterised package then start it and return the UID of the resulting run.
1. Otherwise, start and return the UID of the requested parameterised packages.

The schema of the `runtimePolicy` field in the `api_experiment_start()` payload (in `YAML` format) is:

```yaml
runtimePolicy:
  name: prefer-surrogate
```

## Policy: random-canary-surrogate

In a future version the runtime system will automatically invoke this runtime-policy. However, users can also switch it on manually for their virtual experiment runs.

The algorithm of the policy is:

1. Toss a weighted coin which shows heads with probability `probabilitySurrogate`. If the coin shows heads when it lands then attempt to start 2 virtual experiment instances. The requested one AND a surrogate of the requested one (if available).
   1. If coin shows `heads`: then attempt to start 2 virtual experiment instances. An instance using the requested parameterised package from the `api_experiment_start()` payload and a second one of a suitable surrogate parameterised package (if present). If there is no suitable surrogate parameterised package then start just one run of the requested parameterised package.
   1. Use the same logic as the "prefer-surrogate" to identify one surrogate parameterised package.
2. If the coin shows `tails` then start just the requested parameterised package
3. Return the UID of the instance for the parameterised package.


The schema of the `runtimePolicy` field in the `api_experiment_start()` payload (in `YAML` format) is:


```yaml
runtimePolicy:
  name: random-canary-surrogate
  config: # optional
    probabilitySurrogate: float from 0.0 to 1.0 (optional, default is 0.5)
```
