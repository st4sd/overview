<InlineNotification kind="warning">

If you are not an administrator then, depending on your [user environment](/user-environments), you may not have to install anything. Its recommended you check [first steps](/) to determine if you need to do so.

</InlineNotification>

## Set Up Local Client

<InlineNotification>

- **For**: Researchers & Developers
- **Use When:**
  - You want to run workflows on a Kubernetes/OpenShift instance of the workflow stack **from your laptop** via e.g. a jupyter-notebook
  - You want to develop workflows 
  - You want to test writing/running some simple workflows that can run on your laptop/desktop

</InlineNotification>

The local client install only requires `st4sd-runtime-core`. You can install `st4sd-runtime-core` directly on your laptop using `pip`. 

### Requirements

- `python3` 
   - We recommend that you use python 3.9 although versions 3.7 through 3.10 should work.

### Installing

A simple pip install suffices:

```
pip install "st4sd-runtime-core[deploy]"
```

## Install on OpenShift Local

<InlineNotification>

- **For**: Developers
- **Use When**
  - You want to test, develop and run small-scale virtual experiments on your laptop.
  - You want to develop or examine the ST4SD micro-services on your laptop

</InlineNotification>

### Requirements

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

- OpenShift Local **is only officially supported** on:
  - RedHat Enterprise Linux 7+
  - CentOS 7+
  - The two latest stable Fedora releases
  - Windows 10
  - macOS 11.0 Big Sur or later
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later and Debian 10 or later **are not officially supported** and may require manual setup.

We recommend using a x86 device.
</InlineNotification>
You can deploy a small scale version of <a href="/cloud-orientation">ST4SD Cloud</a> on your personal device using <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview" target="_blank">Red Hat OpenShift Local (formerly Red Hat CodeReady Containers)</a>. To get started with Red Hat OpenShift Local, download the "OpenShift Local" binary (crc) from the <a href="https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local" target="_blank">Red Hat Console</a> website.

 <InlineNotification kind="info">
You need a Red Hat account to use OpenShift Local. If you do not have one, you can get one for free on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/register?intcmp=701f20000012ngPAAQ" target="_blank">Red Hat Developer</a> website.
</InlineNotification>


### One time Setup

After you install OpenShift Local you will get access to the `crc` binary.
Ensure the `crc` binary is in your `${PATH}` for example when you run `crc version` in your terminal you get similar output to:

```
CRC version: 2.22.1+e8068b4
OpenShift version: 4.13.3
Podman version: 4.4.4
```

Below we use `crc` in a script to:

1. create and configure the Virtual Machine that will host OpenShift Local
2. Set the password of the <b>kubeadmin</b> account to `fun` - do not use insecure passwords in production.
3. Deploy ST4SD Cloud on the `st4sd-local` namespace
4. Wait for the ST4SD microservices to go online
5. Open a browser to visit your instance of the Registry UI!
   1. Login as the user `developer` with the password `developer` - this is the default non-admin user that `crc` creates for you.

Copy the text below and execute it in your terminal:

```
cat <<'EOF'>one_time_setup.sh
set -e
crc config set consent-telemetry no
crc setup
# Increase default resource limits for the Virtual Machine
crc config set cpus 8
crc config set memory 14336
crc config set disk-size 50
# Set the password to "fun" - do not use insecure passwords in production
crc start
eval $(crc oc-env)
echo "Login details for your OpenShift Local installation"
crc console --credentials
oc login -u kubeadmin -p fun https://api.crc.testing:6443
oc new-project st4sd-local
echo "Installing ST4SD Cloud"
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/st4sd/st4sd-deployment/main/manifests/openshift-local-minimal-release.yaml
echo "Waiting for the ST4SD services to go online - this will take a couple of minutes"

wait_pod_running() {
    echo -n "Waiting for pod ${1} "
    until oc get pod -n st4sd-local -l deploymentconfig=${1} | grep Running > /dev/null
    do
	echo -n "."
        sleep 5
    done
    echo "Running"
}

wait_pod_running st4sd-authentication
wait_pod_running st4sd-registry-backend
wait_pod_running st4sd-registry-ui
wait_pod_running st4sd-runtime-service
wait_pod_running st4sd-runtime-k8s
wait_pod_running st4sd-datastore-mongodb
wait_pod_running st4sd-datastore-nexus
wait_pod_running st4sd-datastore-cloud-instance

echo "Your ST4SD root URL is https://local.apps-crc.testing"
echo "Access your Registry UI at https://local.apps-crc.testing/registry-ui/"
echo "  You will be asked to login with your OpenShift account."
echo "  Use the developer account."
echo "   username: developer"
echo "   password: developer"
echo "Opening the website now"
open https://local.apps-crc.testing/registry-ui/
EOF
chmod +x one_time_setup.sh

./one_time_setup.sh
```

The script will take 5-15 minutes to complete. While it is building your local ST4SD Cloud deployment, consider exploring the <a href="/running-workflows-on-openshift">ST4SD Services</a> and <a href="/st4sd-registry-getting-started" target="_blank">ST4SD Registry</a> webpages. You can use the information in there to populate your catalog of experiments and more!

### Setting up your Virtual Machine for OpenShift Local

Red Hat OpenShift Local runs as a Virtual Machine on your device.
There is a one-time setup that you need to do using the `crc` command-line utility that you downloaded in the above step.
The default installation of OpenShift Local produces a local OpenShift cluster with:
 - 4 virtual CPU cores,
 - 9 GB of RAM, and
 - 31 GB of storage space

We recommend increasing the defaults with the following:

  ```
  # one time command
  crc setup
  # if OpenShift Local is already running, execute "crc stop" first
  crc config set cpus 8
  crc config set memory 14336
  crc config set disk-size 50
  ```

Below we also change the default password for the <b>kubeadmin</b> so that the instructions are easier to follow.

```
# Set the password to "fun" - do not use insecure passwords in production
crc config kubeadmin-password fun
```

If you ever want to view the credentials for accessing your OpenShift Local instance, you can run

```
crc console --credentials
```

### Starting and Stopping the OpenShift Local Virtual Machine

Recall that OpenShift Local runs as a small scale Virtual Machine on your personal device.
We recommend starting it before you experiment with ST4SD and stopping it when you are done running experiments to release the compute resources that the Virtual Machine is taking up.

To start the virtual machine type:

```
crc start
# Use the `oc` command line interface
eval $(cr oc-env)
# Open a browser to login to OpenShift Web Console
crc console
```

<InlineNotification kind="info">
The command <b>crc start</b> prints useful information on the terminal including how to access the OpenShift Web Console as well as the credentials for the <b>kubeadmin</b> and <b>developer</b> users. In our instructions below we login using the <b>kubeadmin</b> user.
</InlineNotification>

To stop the virtual machine type:
```
crc stop
```

### Installing ST4SD Cloud

When `crc start` finishes printing information on the terminal, your OpenShift Local cluster has started running.
You may now connect using the <b>kubeadmin</b> account:

```bash
# Use the `oc` command line interface
eval $(crc oc-env)
# Ask crc to print the `oc login` commands for you
crc console --credentials
# Now login as the kubeadmin, recall that we set the password to "fun"
oc login -u kubeadmin -p fun https://api.crc.testing:6443
# Open a browser to login to OpenShift Web Console
crc console
```

### Installing

After your OpenShift Local is up and running (i.e. `crc start` has finished). Follow the instructions on your terminal
   to login in as an administrator into OpenShift.
   1. Run `crc console --credentials` to see the `oc login` commands you can type in your terminal.
2. Create the project `st4sd-local`: `oc new-project st4sd-local`.
3. Deploy the minimal version of ST4SD: `oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/st4sd/st4sd-deployment/main/manifests/openshift-local-minimal-release.yaml`.
4. The url to your local instance of ST4SD is https://local.apps-crc.testing
   - You can access your local ST4SD registry-ui at https://local.apps-crc.testing/registry-ui/
   - The very first time you login, OpenShift will inform you that ST4SD wishes to know that you are an authorized user of the system. Accept the OpenShift prompt on your browser.
   - Both default OpenShift accounts (`developer` and `kubeadmin` will have access to your ST4SD microservices).
      - By default, the `developer` account has the password `developer`.
      - You can print the administrator credentials using `crc console --credentials`.


<InlineNotification kind="info">

You can see the credentials of the default accounts that OpenShift Local creates for you by running `crc console --credentials` in your terminal.
