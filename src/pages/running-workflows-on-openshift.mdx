The code here can be tested using the
[ST4SD Runtime API Example notebook](https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples/blob/main/notebooks/ST4SD%20Runtime%20API%20Example.ipynb)

</InlineNotification>

## Overview

We provide a python API for interacting with the ST4SD Services. The API enables
you to:

1. Launch virtual experiment instances
2. Monitor virtual experiment instances
3. Download outputs and measured properties of virtual experiment instances

### Requirements

The basic requirements are access to an OpenShift instance with ST4SD installed
(see the [ST4SD Cloud Installation instructions](/installation) for more
information).

#### Getting data into and out-of virtual experiments: Cloud Object Store

Additionally it can be useful to set up a Cloud Object Store bucket so you can
easily get data into and out-of a virtual experiment.

[See here](/UsingCloudObjectStore) for detailed instructions on how to do this
with IBM Cloud.

### Examples

We maintain a [repository](https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples/) containing
a set of IPython notebooks that illustrate interacting with virtual experiments
via these two methods.

If you are using a
[local JupyterServer environment](/user-environments#local-jupyterserver-with-openshift-st4sd-instance)
execute this snippet to start-up the first notebook illustrating the RESTApi.
Most of the examples discussed here are in this notebook

```
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples.git
cd st4sd-examples
jupyter-notebook notebooks/ST4SD\ Runtime\ API\ Example.ipynb
```

**_Note_: If you've installed `st4sd-runtime-core` into a virtualenv you will
need to activate it before executing above snippet**

After reading this page have a browse around the `st4sd-examples` repository to
see what topics are covered in the other notebooks.

## Connecting to ST4SD

To connect to an ST4SD instance you need to obtain an `auth-token` or use an
`api-key`.

<InlineNotification>

To learn what `auth-token`s and `api-key`s are in ST4SD and how to retrieve
them, read the
[How do I connect to the ST4SD runtime service?](/runtime-service#how-do-i-connect-to-the-st4sd-runtime-service)
section.

</InlineNotification>

The following code blocks show how to connect to an ST4SD instance.

- Connect using an `auth-token`:

    ```python
      import experiment.service.db

      # enter the https:// ST4SD url below
      url="https://${your ST4SD url}"

      # enter your auth-token below
      auth_token="put your authentication/token - do not share it with anyone"

      api=experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI(url, cc_auth_token=auth_token)
    ```

    You can get an auth token by visiting `https://${your ST4SD url}/authorisation/token`.

- Connect using an `api-key`:

    ```python
      import experiment.service.db

      # enter the https:// ST4SD url below
      url="https://${your ST4SD url}"

      # enter your auth-token below
      bearer_key="put your api-key - do not share it with anyone"

      api=experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI(url, cc_bearer_key=bearer_key)
    ```

    You can use the openshift token of service accounts for which there exists a Kubernetes RoleBinding to the `st4sd-authenticate-microservices` Role.
    See our documentation on managing users with [ST4SD Cloud](/cloud-manage-users#give-a-group-of-users-access-to-just-the-st4sd-microservices) for more details.

<InlineNotification>

ST4SD may print warnings to your python terminal e.g.
`Unable to import tinydb module - tinydb interface not available`. These are not
problems. They are just informing you that select features are not supported on
the machine you are using. You can ignore them.

</InlineNotification>

The `ExperimentRestAPI` initializer validates the authentication token you
provided and will raise an exception if it is invalid. If you do not get an
Exception that means you can use `api` to interact with the
`st4sd-runtime-service` and `st4sd-datastore` REST-APIs.

The above code needs to be executed once in a notebook session to get an `api`
instance to interact with. All the following examples assume this step has been
done.

<InlineNotification>

ST4SD may print warnings to your python terminal e.g.
`Unable to import pythonlsf - limited LSF functionality will be available`.
These are not problems. They are just informing you that select features are not
supported on the machine you are using. You can ignore them.

</InlineNotification>

## Adding a virtual experiment package

Before you can run a virtual experiment you need to add it to your ST4SD
registry. You do this using the `api_experiment_push()` method.

Technically you add a _parameterised_ virtual experiment package. A
parameterised package can define particular, potentially complex values, for
variables in the virtual experiment to enable specific behaviour and make them
easier to consume.

You can either type the definition of the
[parameterised package](/creating-a-parameterised-package) manually or import it
from another ST4SD registry
[(e.g. the global ST4SD registry)](/using-the-virtual-experiments-registry-ui).
In the second-case the registry UI provides with the exact `api_experiment_push`
call you need to execute.

## Running a virtual experiment

The API call `api_experiment_start` will start the virtual experiment that a
parameterised virtual experiment package points to e.g.,

```python
rest_uid = api.api_experiment_start(experimentIdentifier, payload=...)
```

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

The above example assumes `experimentIdentifier` is a valid [identifier](/creating-a-parameterised-package#the-parameterised-virtual-experiment-package-identifier-(pvep-identifier)) of a
parameterised package (meaning the name of a Parameterised Virtual Experiment Package, with an optional
[tag or SHA identifier](/creating-a-parameterised-package#package-tags)). The
value of `payload` is a python dictionary that contains the run options to the
experiment.

</InlineNotification>

When you run a given virtual experiment you create a _virtual experiment
instance_. Each instance is assigned a unique identifier which is returned when
you start the virtual experiment. We use the term `ExperimentRunID` and
`rest_uid` to refer to such identifiers.

Starting an experiment involves:

1. specifying experiment inputs
2. (optional) specifying experiment variables
3. (optional) selecting an experiment platform
4. (optional) specifying experiment data

The following sections explain how to fill in the `payload`.

### Specifying experiment inputs

_inputs_ are files the experiment requires to run - they must be provided. Each
experiments documentation should explain what these files are.

The inputs are specified via the key `inputs` in the payload. The value of this
key is a list that has one item, a dictionary, for each required input file
e.g.,

```python
payload = {
    "inputs": [
      {...},
      ...
    ]
}
```

You can provide the content of input files directly in the payload using the
`content` key

```python
data = pd.read_csv('mydata.csv')
payload = {
    "inputs": [{
       "content": data.to_csv(index=False),
       "filename": "input_filename.csv"
   }]

}
```

This specifies that the content of the input file `input_filename.csv` comes
from the pandas DataFrame `data`.

### Specifying experiment variables

_variables_ are optional parameters controlling the behaviour of the experiment,
e.g. number of cpus. They are experiment specific i.e. the same variables don't
exist in all experiment and variables controlling similar behaviour in two
experiments may not have the same name.

<InlineNotification>

_variables_ can only be overridden if the parameterised package allows it. If
this is the case the variables that can be set will be listed in the
`executionOptions` section in the package description

</InlineNotification>

_variables_ are set using the `variables` key in the payload. The value of this
key is a dictionary of variable-name, variable-value pairs.

```python
payload = {
    ... #Input/data options elided
   "variables": {
        "startIndex": 0,
        "numberMolecules": 1,
    }
}
```

### Selecting an experiment platform

There are cases where variables are dependent on the values of other variables. ST4SD implements a feature called
experiment `platform` to help with these scenarios.

You can think of an experiment platform as a specialization of the experiment for a specific use case. Here are some
of the ways developers use experiment platforms:

1. maintain a single experiment definition which can execute on multiple different compute environments (OpenShift, HPC, ocal mode, local mode with containers, etc )
2. support mass-configuration of steps to account for different scenarios (e.g. using less accurate methods which are faster to compute, etc)
3. enable debug mode to assist debugging

and many more!

The workflow developer can then use the [parameterised package section](/creating-a-parameterised-package#the-parameterisation-section) of experiments
to encode the available options for running the experiment.

If the experiment has a `preset` platform (i.e. the field `parameterisation.presets.platform` of the Parameterised Virtual Experiment Package definition is set) then the user does not get the option to select which platform to use for the execution of the experiment. This option is hard-coded.

If the experiment has a configurable platform (i.e. the field `parameterisation.executionOptions.platforms` is set) then the user can select any of the options under `parameterisation.executionOptions.platforms`. If the user does not explicitly set a platform then the experiment instance will use the 1st platform in the `parameterisation.executionOptions.platforms` array.


### Specifying experiment data

_data_ refers to experiment configuration files that **may** be overridden by
the user.

<InlineNotification>

_data_ files can only be overridden if the parameterised package allows it. If
this is the case the files will be listed in the `executionOptions` section in
the package description

</InlineNotification>

The data files are specified via the key `data` in the payload. The value of
this key is a list that has one item, a dictionary, for each `data` file you
want to override e.g.,

```python
payload = {
    "data": [
      {...},
      ...
    ]
}
```

The format of the `data` dictionary is identical to the `input` dictionary.

Providing data files via S3/Datashim or providing their content directly follows
same process as described for inputs. See those sections for details.

### Payload Details

The following is the complete structure of the `api_experiment_start()` payload
(in `YAML`). This includes some advanced options not discussed here.

```yaml
platform: name of platform (optional - see parameterisation notes)
inputs: # optional (parameterised packages may have no inputs)
  # see notes for interaction with Dataset/S3
  - filename: str # required
    content: str # optional - see S3 notes
data: # optional (parameterised packages may have no overiddable data files)
  # see notes for interaction with Dataset/S3
  - filename: str # required
    content: str # optional - see S3 notes
volumes: # optional
  - type:
      # children fields are mutually exclusive - there must be exactly 1
      persistentVolumeClaim: name of PVC object
      dataset: name of Datashim dataset (see notes)
      configMap: name of ConfigMap object
      secret: name of Secret object
    applicationDependency: name of appDep to bind to volume (optional)
    # subPath applies only to pvc and dataset types
    subPath: path inside volume to mount (optional, defaults to root of object)
variables: # optional - must adhere to parameterisation rules (see notes)
  $name: $value
additionalOptions: # optional runtime arguments to elaunch.py
  # they cannot override runtime arguments in the package parameterisation
  - "--someArgument=value"
environmentVariables: # optional
  # creates environment variable in the pod that hosts elaunch.py
  $name: $value
metadata: # optional
  # custom metadata to insert into the "user-metadata" MongoDB document of run
  $name: $value
s3: # optional - used to read inputs/data with no "content" field
  # dataset is mutually exclusive with any other sibling fields
  dataset: name of Datashim dataset # optional
  # can only provide fields below if dataset is unset
  accessKeyID: S3 accessKeyID # optional
  secretAccessKey: S3 secretAccessKey # optional
  bucket: name of S3 bucket # optional
  endpoint: the s3 endpoint # optional
  region: the s3 region # optional
# s3Store and datasetStoreURI are mutually exclusive and both optional
# when one is provided, orchestrator uploads key-outputs to S3 after Run terminates
s3Store: # optional
  bucketPath:
    path under bucket to store key-outputs files (default is
    "workflow_instances/")
  credentials: (same as s3 field)
datasetStoreURI: a "dataset/$bucketPath" URI (optional)
runtimePolicy: # optional
  name: the name of the runtime policy (required)
  config: # optional
    $key: Any # each runtime-policy has its own config-schema
```

<InlineNotification kind="info">

The schema above is in YAML format. If you are using python (i.e. an instance of
`experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI`) you should either create an
equivalent python dictionary OR a python string that contains the yaml
definition and then convert the string into a dictionary using
`yaml.loads(the_string)`.

</InlineNotification>

**Notes**

1. `inputs` and `data` file-specifications have an optional `content` field. If
   this field is missing then the contents of the files are expected to exist on
   S3 or in a Dataset. When `s3` exists then the `filename` field acts as the
   path inside the S3 bucket (or dataset) to use for reading the content of the
   input/data file.
1. Dataset objects are only available if a cluster-admin has installed
   [Datashim](https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim) on the cluster.
1. The fields `additionalOptions`, `data`, `inputs`, `platform`, and `variables`
   must adhere to parameterisation rules. See the
   [parameterised package documentation](/creating-a-parameterised-package#the-parameterisation-section)
   for more information.

## Getting the status of a virtual experiment instance

A common user-task is to check the status of a virtual experiment instance. For
example, to see if it is still running, or, if finished, if there was any error.

The API method `api_rest_uid_status` returns the status of a given `rest_uid`:

```python
# put here the rest_uid of the virtual experiment instance
rest_uid = "toxicity-predictions-trol7a"

status = api.api_rest_uid_status(rest_uid)
```

The variable `status` contains various information about the virtual experiment
instance in addition to its status. The _execution_ status is under the `status`
key, you can inspect by executing:

```python
import json
print(json.dumps(status['status'], indent=2))
```

The most important field is `exit-status`. ST4SD sets it after an experiment terminates.

Possible values:

- **Success**: The experiment existed successfully
- **Failed**: The experiment failed (at least one component)
- **Stopped**: The experiment was stopped/killed
- **N/A**: The experiment is running and doesn't have an exit-status yet
- **""** (Empty): The experiment has not started.

For the full schema of the `status` dictionary see the section describing the [status of an experiment instance](#the-status-of-an-experiment-instance).

## Get the details of a virtual experiment instance

In addition to the execution status information the `status` key also contains
metadata on the experiment. To see it:

```python
import json
print(json.dumps(status['status']['meta'], indent=2))
```

This will print a dictionary with the following keys

- `arguments`: The command-line of the orchestrator
- `data`: The list of files that override data files
- `input`: The list of input files
- `pid`: The process ID of the st4sd orchestrator
- `platform`: The name of the platform that the virtual experiment instance
  executes
- `userVariables`: User provided variables, the schema is
  `{'global':{name:value}, 'stages':{index:{name:value}}}`
- `variables`: Global and stage variables active in the `platform`-scope that
  the virtual experiment executes. The schema is
  `{'global':{name:value}, 'stages':{index:{name:value}}}`
- `hybridPlatform`: Name of hybrid-platform for communicating with LSF (can be
  None),
- `userMetadata`: A dictionary with `key(str): Any` value pairs that users can
  provide
- `instanceName`: The name of the directory containing the virtual experiment
  instance.
- `version`: The version of the st4sd orchestrator

## Retrieving the outputs of a virtual experiment instance

There are multiple ways to retrieve outputs of virtual experiments: via a
virtual experiment interface, key-outputs, the Datastore APIs, and by leveraging
ST4SD's automated upload to S3.

<AnchorLinks small>

  <AnchorLink>Retrieving key-outputs</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Automatically uploading key-outputs to S3</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>

  </AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Retrieving outputs via the ST4SD Datastore APIs</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

### Retrieving the properties measured by an experiment

Some virtual experiments define interfaces which make it simple for users to
retrieve the input systems and measured properties from runs of that virtual
experiment.

Learn how to use virtual experiment interfaces [here](/using-a-virtual-experiment-interface/#getting-the-properties).

### Retrieving key-outputs

Key-Outputs are files produced by an experiment that the developer has flagged
as being of special interest. Since the names of the file can be generic the
developer gives the key-output a descriptive label to better explain what it is.

Information on the key-outputs of a virtual experiment instance are stored in
the dictionary returned by `api_rest_uid_status`

```python
status = api.api_rest_uid_status(restUID)
pprint.pprint(instance_status['outputs'])
```

An example of the output of this is

```python
{'OptimisationResults': {'creationtime': '1669584128.077387',
                         'description': '',
                         'filename': 'energies.csv',
                         'filepath': 'stages/stage1/ExtractEnergies/energies.csv',
                         'final': 'yes',
                         'production': 'yes',
                         'type': '',
                         'version': '1'}}
```

In the above example, the experiment has one key-output called **OptimisationResults**. This
refers to a file `energies.csv` produced by the component `ExtractEnergies` in
the given experiment.

To retrieve a key-output we can use `api_rest_uid_output`. This method returns
the contents as bytes so it needs to be converted to a string. Note: replace
`OptimisationResults` with the name of a key-output relevant to an experiment
you have run.

```python
filename, contents = api.api_rest_uid_output(rest_uid, 'OptimisationResults')
contents = contents.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
# read it into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(contents), sep=",", skipinitialspace=True)
```

### Automatically uploading key-outputs to S3

ST4SD supports automatically uploading key-outputs to S3. To enable this feature
include the following values in the `payload` you provide to
`api.api_experiment_start(experimentId, payload)` (see
[Running a virtual experiment](#running-a-virtual-experiment) for more
information):

<InlineNotification>

See the [Cloud Object Store](/UsingCloudObjectStore) page for examples of
getting the values to populate the `credentials` section.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

Note that `bucketPath` is optional and it defaults to `/`.

</InlineNotification>

The following example stores the key-outputs under `run1_output` in an bucket
called`my-bucket`

```json
"s3Store":{
      "credentials": {
        "accessKeyID": "$S3_AccessKeyID",
        "secretAccessKey": "$S3_SecretAccessKey",
        "endpoint": "$S3_ENDPOINT",
        "region": "$S3_Region",
        "bucket": "my-bucket"
      },
      "bucketPath": "/run1_output/"
    },
```

### Listing outputs produced by virtual experiment components

Before being able to retrieve the contents of the output files that the
virtual experiment components produce we need to know their paths. We start by
retrieving the list of components that were part of our experiment through these
two calls:

```python
metadata = api.cdb_get_user_metadata_document_for_rest_uid(rest_uid)
components = api.cdb_get_document_component(instance=metadata['instance'])
```

The list of full paths of the output files produced by each components will then
be available using the `files` key. We can access it for component `0` as such:

```python
component_0_files=components[0]['files']
```

### Retrieving outputs via the ST4SD Datastore APIs

To retrieve outputs we use the `cdb_get_file_from_instance_uri` function.

<InlineNotification>

In this example we reference variables that we retrieved in the previous section
([Listing outputs produced by virtual experiment components](#listing-outputs-produced-by-virtual-experiment-components))

</InlineNotification>

This function, however, expects to receive relative paths instead of full ones.
We can change our list of paths with this list comprehension:

```python
component_0_files_relative = [component_file[component_file.index('/stages/'):] for component_file in component_0_files]
```

Here we show how to retrieve the first file produced by component `0` from the
previous example:

```python
data = api.cdb_get_file_from_instance_uri(document[0]['instance'], component_0_files_relative[0])
```

## Stopping a virtual experiment instance

The API call to cancel and delete a virtual experiment instance is
`api_rest_uid_delete`. Use this if you want to stop a run for any reason.

The `api_rest_uid_delete()` method _does not affect the files_ that the run has
already generated. However, it does cause the run, and any components that are
still running, to terminate. It also deletes any Kubernetes objects that have
been created by the run.

You may also use this to delete Kubernetes objects created for running this
virtual experiment instance. Note that deleting the virtual experiment instance
**does not** affect the files that it has produced.

```python
# put here the rest_uid of the virtual experiment instance
rest_uid = "toxicity-predictions-trol7a"

api.api_rest_uid_delete(rest_uid)
```

## More options when starting an experiment

### Providing inputs via S3

If your input file is in an s3 bucket or a Datashim dataset you use the `s3`
top-level key of the payload dictionary to provides details for accessing the
bucket/dataset.

<InlineNotification>

- Only one bucket/dataset can be specified in the payload i.e. all files you
  want to pass an experiment from s3 must be in the same bucket/dataset
- The value of the `filename` key should be the path inside the bucket/dataset to find
  the file.
- If the filenames in the bucket/dataset do not match the names expected by the experiment you can ask ST4SD to map the S3 files to the input files by suffixing the S3 uri with the name of the input file: e.g. you can map the file `/path/my-file` to the input `my-input` with the following filename definition: `"filename": "path/my-file:my-input"`

</InlineNotification>

Example: Using s3. Fill the `s3` parameters with the required values. In this
case `input_filename.csv` is in the top-level of the bucket.

```python
payload = {
    "inputs": [{
       "filename": "input_filename.csv"
   }],
  "s3": {
      "accessKeyID": "$S3_AccessKeyID",
      "secretAccessKey": "$S3_SecretAccessKey",
      "bucket": "$S3_BUCKET_NAME",
      "endpoint": "$S3_ENDPOINT",
      "region": "$S3_Region"
  }
}
```

### Providing inputs using Datashim


[Datashim](https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim) is a Kubernetes Framework that presents S3 and NFS storage
to pods in the form of PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) resources. Datashims introduces a custom resource
called Dataset which acts as a proxy to the S3 and NFS storage. The framework orchestrates the provisioning
of Persistent Volume Claims and ConfigMaps needed for each Dataset. To enable support for using Datasets to
provide your input and data files to experiments there is a a one-time step for the
entire cluster. A cluster-administrator must follow the installation instructions for Datashim in
https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim#quickstart.

Following that, users can create Datasets in a namespace that holds the ST4SD deployment following the
instructions in <https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim>.


<InlineNotification>

- If the filenames in the bucket do not match the names expected by the experiment you can ask ST4SD to map
  the files in the Dataset to the input files by suffixing the S3 uri with the name of the input file:
  e.g. you can map the file `path/my-file` to the input `my-input` with the following filename definition:
  `"filename": "path/my-file:my-input"`
- Only one dataset can be specified in the payload i.e. all files you
  want to pass an experiment must be in the same Dataset
- The value of the `filename` key should be the path inside the Dataset to find the file.

</InlineNotification>

In the below example, the experiment will load the input `input_filename.csv` from the path
`data/input_filename.csv` in the dataset `$MYDATASET_NAME`.

```python

payload = {
    "inputs": [{
       "filename": "data/input_filename.csv"
   }],
  "s3": {
      "dataset": "$MYDATASET_NAME"
  }
}
```

## The status of an experiment instance

Use the following python code to get the status of an experiment instance:

```python
# put here the rest_uid of the virtual experiment instance
rest_uid = "toxicity-predictions-trol7a"

status = api.api_rest_uid_status(rest_uid)
```

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Values are case sensitive

</InlineNotification>

- `experiment-state`: Indicates the execution state of the experiment instance

  - **Possible Values**:
    - **unscheduled**: The experiment has not been scheduled to run yet. This
      can be due to lack of resources, which may resolve, or be a critical issue
      (unable to pull ST4SD images, unable to mount volumes)
    - **unschedulable**: Required pre-tasks for the experiment execution failed
      e.g. could not get workflow source, could not download s3 inputs.
    - **Initialising**: The experiment is starting up
    - **running**: The experiment has started running components
    - **waiting_on_resource**: A component in the active stage is waiting on
      resource
    - **suspended**: The workflow execution has been suspended
    - **finished**: The experiment is finished.
    - **failed**: **Only** set if the experiment encountered an error during
      initialisation (failed to run any steps of workflow after being started).
      For example, fail to parse arguments, fail to create directory structures.

- `exit-status`: Indicates how a **completed** experiment exited

  - This receives its final value _after_ `experiment-state` transitions to
    either `finished` or, in rare circumstances, `failed` (see above). Value
    will be "N/A" or "" (empty) before this.
  - **Possible Values**:
    - **Success**: The experiment existed successfully
    - **Failed**: The experiment failed (at least one component)
    - **Stopped**: The experiment was stopped/killed
    - **N/A**: The experiment is running and doesn't have an exit-status yet
    - **""** (Empty): The experiment has not started.

- `error-description`: If the `exit-status` is **_Failed_** the value of this
  key is a string which explains the failure cause.
- `total-progress`: A number in [0.0, 1.0] indicating the progress of the
  experiment. Note that workflow developers may decide to control this value.

- `current-stage`: UID (e.g. `stage0`) of the active stage with the lowest stage
  index

- `stage-state`: Indicates the state of the active stage (a stage with a
  component running) with with the lowest stage index. Value is one of
  `["Initialising", "finished", "waiting_on_resource","running", "component_shutdown", "failed"]`

- `stage-progress`: A number in [0.0, 1.0] indicating the progress of the active
  stage with the lowest stage index. Note that workflow developers may decide to
  control this value.

<InlineNotification>

An experiment status can have `experiment-state=finished` with
`exit-status=failed`. This means that the experiment completed with a failure.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

In the case where there are no systems issues preventing an experiment to start
`experiment-state` will always become `finished`. **You must check `exit-status`
for errors.**

</InlineNotification>

Here is an example of the status dictionary

```json
{
  "experiment-state": "finished",
  "total-progress": 1.0,
  "exit-status": "Success",
  "stages": [
    "Toxicity-prediction"
  ],
  "current-stage": "Toxicity-prediction",
  "stage-state": "finished",
  "stage-progress": 1.0,
  "error-description": "",
  "meta": { ... omitted ... }
}
```

In the above example:

1. The orchestrator observed that the virtual experiment instance terminated
   (`experiment-state` = `finished`)
2. The virtual experiment instance has produced all its outputs
   (`total-progress` = `1.0`)
3. The virtual experiment instance completed successfully (`exit-status` =
   `Success`)
4. The experiment had 1 stage (`stages` = `["Toxicity-prediction"]`)
5. `Toxicity-prediction` was the most recently executed stage with the lowest
   stage index (`current-stage` = `Toxicity-prediction`).
   1. All its tasks terminated and they were all successful (`stage-state` =
      `finished`)
   2. It reached its max progress (`stage-progress` = `1.0`)
6. The virtual experiment instance did not raise any errors (`error-description`
   = `""`)
