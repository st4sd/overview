The code here can be tested using the [ST4SD Runtime API Example notebook](https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples/blob/main/notebooks/ST4SD%20Runtime%20API%20Example.ipynb)

</InlineNotification>

## Overview

We provide a python API for ease of use of virtual experiment in an iPython notebook setting. The features the API enables includes:

1. launching virtual experiment instances
2. monitoring virtual experiment instances
3. downloading outputs and measured properties of virtual experiment instances

The Python API is a wrapper around a RESTapi. You can find RESTapi documentation [here](/api-docs/openapi/st4sd-runtime-service/st4sd-runtime-service.openapi.html).
In addition, we provide a python API to our `st4sd-datastore` which allows deeper querying and data-retrieval from completed virtual experiments in a notebook. 

### Requirements

The basic requirements are access to an OpenShift instance with ST4SD installed (see [first steps](/) for more information).

#### Getting data into and out-of virtual experiments: Cloud Object Store

Additionally it can be useful to set up a Cloud Object Store bucket so you can easily get data into and out-of a virtual experiment.

[See here](/UsingCloudObjectStore) for detailed instructions on how to do this with IBM Cloud.

### Examples

We maintain a [repository](https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples/) containing a set of IPython notebooks that illustrate interacting with virtual experiments via these two methods.

If you are using a [local JupyterServer environment](/user-environments#local-jupyterserver-with-openshift-st4sd-instance) execute this snippet to start-up the first notebook illustrating the RESTApi. Most of the examples discussed here are in this notebook

```
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/st4sd-examples.git
cd st4sd-examples
jupyter-notebook notebooks/ST4SD\ Runtime\ API\ Example.ipynb
```

***Note*: If you've installed `st4sd-runtime-core` into a virtualenv you will need to activate it before executing above snippet**

After reading this page have a browse around the `st4sd-examples` repository to see what topics are covered in the other notebooks.

## Connecting to ST4SD

To connect to an ST4SD instance you need to obtain an `auth-token` or use an `api-key`. Please refer to [How do I connect to the ST4SD runtime service?](/runtime-service#how-do-i-connect-to-the-st4sd-runtime-service).

The following code blocks show how to connect to an ST4SD instance.

- Connect using an `auth-token`:
```python
  import experiment.service.db

  # enter the https:// ST4SD url below
  url="https://${your ST4SD url}"

  # enter your auth-token below
  auth_token="put your authentication/token - do not share it with anyone"

  api=experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI(url, cc_auth_token=auth_token)
```
- Connect using an `api-key`:
```python
  import experiment.service.db

  # enter the https:// ST4SD url below
  url="https://${your ST4SD url}"

  # enter your auth-token below
  bearer_key="put your api-key - do not share it with anyone"

  api=experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI(url, cc_bearer_key=bearer_key)
```


<InlineNotification>
ST4SD may print warnings to your python terminal e.g. `Unable to import tinydb module - tinydb interface not available`. These are not problems. They are just informing you that select features are not supported on the machine you are using. You can ignore them.
</InlineNotification>



The `ExperimentRestAPI` initializer validates the authentication token you provided and will raise an exception if it is invalid. 
If you do not get an Exception that means you can use `api` to interact with the `st4sd-runtime-service` and `st4sd-datastore` REST-APIs.

The above code needs to be executed once in a notebook session to get an `api` instance to interact with. All the following examples assume this step has been done. 

<InlineNotification>

ST4SD may print warnings to your python terminal e.g. `Unable to import pythonlsf - limited LSF functionality will be available`. These are not problems. They are just informing you that select features are not supported on the machine you are using. You can ignore them.

</InlineNotification>

## Adding a virtual experiment package

Before you can run a virtual experiment you need to add it to your ST4SD registry. You do this using the `api_experiment_push()` method. 

Technically you add a *parameterised* virtual experiment package. A parameterised package can define particular, potentially complex values, for variables in the virtual experiment to enable specific behaviour and make them easier to consume. 

You can either type the definition of the [parameterised package](/creating-a-parameterised-package) manually or import it from another ST4SD registry  [(e.g. the global ST4SD registry)](/using-the-virtual-experiments-registry-ui). In the second-case the registry UI provides with the exact `api_experiment_push` call you need to execute. 

## Running a virtual experiment

The API call `api_experiment_start` will start the virtual experiment that a parameterised virtual experiment package points to e.g., 

```python
rest_uid = api.api_experiment_start(experimentIdentifier, payload=...)
```

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

The above example assumes `experimentIdentifier` is a valid identifier of a parameterised package. The value of `payload` is a python dictionary that contains the run options to the experiment.

</InlineNotification>

When you run a given virtual experiment you create a *virtual experiment instance*.  Each instance is assigned a unique identifier which is returned when you start the virtual experiment.  We use the term `ExperimentRunID` and `rest_uid` to refer to such identifiers.

The following sections explain how to fill the `payload`.

### Specifying experiment inputs 

*inputs* are files the experiment requires to run - they must be provided. Each experiments documentation should explain what these files are. 

The inputs are specified via the key `inputs` in the payload. The value of this key is a list that has one item, a dictionary, for each required input file e.g.,

```python
payload = {
    "inputs": [
      {...},
      ...
    ]
}
```

#### Providing inputs via s3 or Datashim dataset

If your input file is in an s3 bucket or a Datashim dataset you use the `s3` top-level key of the payload dictionary to provides details for accessing the bucket/dataset.

<InlineNotification>

* Currently the filenames in the bucket must have the same names as expected by the experiment
* Only one bucket/dataset can be specified in the payload i.e. all files you want to pass an experiment from s3 must be in the same bucket
* The value of the `filename` key should be the path inside the bucket to find the file. 

</InlineNotification>

Example: Using s3. Fill the `s3` parameters with the required values. In this case `input_filename.csv` is in the top-level of the bucket. 

```python
payload = {
    "inputs": [{
       "filename": "input_filename.csv"
   }],
  "s3": { 
      "accessKeyID": "$S3_AccessKeyID",           
      "secretAccessKey": "$S3_SecretAccessKey", 
      "bucket": "$S3_BUCKET_NAME",           
      "endpoint": "$S3_ENDPOINT",           
      "region": "$S3_Region"                 
  }  
}
```

Example: Using Datashim. In this case `input_filename.csv` is at path `data/input_filename.csv`

```python

payload = {
    "inputs": [{
       "filename": "data/input_filename.csv"
   }],
  "s3": { 
      "dataset": "$MYDATASET_NAME"               
  }  
}
```



#### Providing input content directly 

You can provide the content of input files directly in the payload using the `content` key

```python
data = pd.read_csv('mydata.csv')
payload = {
    "inputs": [{
       "content": data.to_csv(index=False),
       "filename": "input_filename.csv"
   }]

}
```

This specifies that the content of the input file `input_filename.csv` comes from the pandas DataFrame `data`. 

### Specifying experiment data 

*data* refers to experiment configuration files that **may** be overridden by the user. 

<InlineNotification>

*data* files can only be overridden if the parameterised package allows it. If this is the case the files will be listed in the `executionOptions` section in the package description

</InlineNotification>

The data files are specified via the key `data` in the payload. The value of this key is a list that has one item, a dictionary, for each `data`  file you want to override e.g.,

```python
payload = {
    "data": [
      {...},
      ...
    ]
}
```

The format of the `data` dictionary is identical to the `input` dictionary. 

Providing  data files via S3/Datashim or providing their content directly follows same process as described for inputs. See those sections for details. 

### Specifying experiment variables

*variables* are optional parameters controlling the behaviour of the experiment, e.g. number of cpus. They are experiment specific i.e. the same variables don't exist in all experiment and  variables controlling similar behaviour in two experiments may not have the same name. 

<InlineNotification>

*variables* can only be overridden if the parameterised package allows it. If this is the case the variables that can be set will be listed in the `executionOptions` section in the package description

</InlineNotification>

*variables* are set using the `variables` key in the payload. The value of this key is a dictionary of variable-name, variable-value pairs.

```python
payload = {
    ... #Input/data options elided
   "variables": {
        "startIndex": 0,
        "numberMolecules": 1,
    }
}
```



### Payload Details

The following is the complete structure of the `api_experiment_start()` payload (in `YAML`). This includes some advanced options not discussed here. 

```yaml
platform: name of platform (optional - see parameterisation notes)
inputs: # optional (parameterised packages may have no inputs)
# see notes for interaction with Dataset/S3
- filename: str # required
  content: str # optional - see S3 notes
data: # optional (parameterised packages may have no overiddable data files)
# see notes for interaction with Dataset/S3
- filename: str # required
  content: str # optional - see S3 notes
volumes: # optional
- type:
    # children fields are mutually exclusive - there must be exactly 1
    persistentVolumeClaim: name of PVC object
    dataset: name of Datashim dataset (see notes)
    configMap: name of ConfigMap object
    secret: name of Secret object

  $name: $value
additionalOptions: # optional runtime arguments to elaunch.py
 # they cannot override runtime arguments in the package parameterisation
 - "--someArgument=value"
environmentVariables: # optional
 # creates environment variable in the pod that hosts elaunch.py
 $name: $value

  accessKeyID: S3 accessKeyID           # optional
  secretAccessKey: S3 secretAccessKey   # optional
  bucket: name of S3 bucket             # optional
  endpoint: the s3 endpoint             # optional
  region: the s3 region                 # optional
# s3Store and datasetStoreURI are mutually exclusive and both optional
# when one is provided, orchestrator uploads key-outputs to S3 after Run terminates
s3Store: # optional
  bucketPath: path under bucket to store key-outputs files (default is "workflow_instances/")
  credentials: (same as s3 field)
datasetStoreURI: a "dataset/$bucketPath" URI (optional)
runtimePolicy: # optional
  name: the name of the runtime policy (required)
  config: # optional
    $key: Any # each runtime-policy has its own config-schema
```


<InlineNotification kind="info">

The schema above is in YAML format. If you are using python (i.e. an instance of `experiment.service.db.ExperimentRestAPI`) you should either create an equivalent python dictionary OR a python string that contains the yaml definition and then convert the string into a dictionary using `yaml.loads(the_string)`.

</InlineNotification>

**Notes**


1. `inputs` and `data` file-specifications have an optional `content` field. If this field is missing then the contents of the files are expected to exist on S3 or in a Dataset. When `s3` exists then the `filename` field acts as the path inside the S3 bucket (or dataset) to use for reading the content of the input/data file.
1. Dataset objects are only available if a cluster-admin has installed [Datashim](https://github.com/datashim-io/datashim) on the cluster.
1. The fields `additionalOptions`, `data`, `inputs`, `platform`, and `variables` must adhere to parameterisation rules. See the [parameterised package documentation](/creating-a-parameterised-package#the-parameterisation-section) for more information.




## Getting the status of a virtual experiment instance

A common user-task is to check the status of a virtual experiment instance. For example, to see if it is still running, or, if finished, if there was any error. 

The API method `api_rest_uid_status` returns the status of a given `rest_uid`: 

```python
# put here the rest_uid of the virtual experiment instance
rest_uid = "toxicity-predictions-trol7a"

status = api.api_rest_uid_status(rest_uid)
```

The variable `status` contains various information about the virtual experiment instance in addition to its  status. The *execution* status is under the `status` key, you can inspect by executing:

```python
import json
print(json.dumps(status['status'], indent=2))
```

This will print a dictionary with the following keys (among others). The potential values of these keys is also described.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

Values are case sensitive


</InlineNotification>

- `experiment-state`: Indicates the execution state of the experiment instance
  
  - **Possible Values**: 
    - **unscheduled**: The experiment has not been scheduled to run yet. This can be due to lack of resources, which may resolve, or be a critical issue (unable to pull ST4SD images, unable to mount volumes)
    - **unschedulable**: Required pre-tasks for the experiment execution failed e.g. could not get workflow source, could not download s3 inputs.
    - **Initialising**: The experiment is starting up
    - **running**: The experiment has started running components
    - **waiting_on_resource**: A component in the active stage is waiting on resource
    - **suspended**: The workflow execution has been suspended
    - **finished**: The experiment is finished. 
    - **failed**: **Only** set if the experiment encountered an error during initialisation (failed to run any steps of workflow after being started). For example, fail to parse arguments, fail to create directory structures.
  
- `exit-status`: Indicates how a **completed** experiment exited
  
  - This receives its final value *after* `experiment-state` transitions to either `finished` or, in rare circumstances, `failed` (see above). Value will be "N/A" or "" (empty) before this. 
  - **Possible Values**: 
    - **Success**: The experiment existed successfully
    - **Failed**: The experiment failed (at least one component)
    - **Stopped**: The experiment was stopped/killed
    - **N/A**: The experiment is running and doesn't have an exit-status yet
    - **""** (Empty): The experiment has not started. 
  
- `error-description`: If the `exit-status` is  ***Failed*** the value of this key is a string which explains the failure cause. 
  
- `total-progress`: A number in [0.0, 1.0] indicating the progress of the experiment. Note that workflow developers may decide to control this value.

- `current-stage`: UID (e.g. `stage0`) of the active stage with the lowest stage index 

- `stage-state`: Indicates the state of the active stage (a stage with a component running) with with the lowest stage index. Value is one of `["Initialising", "finished", "waiting_on_resource","running", "component_shutdown", "failed"]`

- `stage-progress`: A number in [0.0, 1.0] indicating the progress of the active stage with the lowest stage index. Note that workflow developers may decide to control this value.

  

<InlineNotification>

An experiment status can have `experiment-state=finished` with `exit-status=failed`. This means that the experiment completed with a failure. 

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

In the case where there are no systems issues preventing an experiment to start `experiment-state` will always become `finished`. **You must check `exit-status` for errors.** 

</InlineNotification>




Here is an example of the status dictionary

```json
{
  "experiment-state": "finished",
  "total-progress": 1.0,
  "exit-status": "Success",
  "stages": [
    "Toxicity-prediction"
  ],
  "current-stage": "Toxicity-prediction",
  "stage-state": "finished",
  "stage-progress": 1.0,
  "error-description": "",
  "meta": { ... omitted ... }
}
```

This reports that:
1. The orchestrator observed that the virtual experiment instance terminated (`experiment-state` = `finished`)
2. The virtual experiment instance has produced all its outputs (`total-progress` = `1.0`)
3. The virtual experiment instance completed successfully (`exit-status` = `Success`)
4. The experiment had 1 stage (`stages` = `["Toxicity-prediction"]`)
5. `Toxicity-prediction` was the most recently executed stage with the lowest stage index (`current-stage` = `Toxicity-prediction`).
   1. All its tasks terminated and they were all successful (`stage-state` = `finished`)
   2. It reached its max progress (`stage-progress` = `1.0`)
6. The virtual experiment instance did not raise any errors (`error-description` = `""`)




## Inspect the metadata of a virtual experiment instance

In addition to the execution status information the `status` key also contains metadata on the experiment. To see it:

```python
import json
print(json.dumps(status['status']['meta'], indent=2))
```

This will print a dictionary with the following keys
- `arguments`: The command-line of the orchestrator
- `data`: The list of files that override data files
- `input`: The list of input files
- `pid`: The process ID of the st4sd orchestrator
- `platform`: The name of the platform that the virtual experiment instance executes
- `userVariables`: User provided variables, the schema is  `{'global':{name:value}, 'stages':{index:{name:value}}}`
- `variables`: Global and stage variables active in the `platform`-scope that the virtual experiment executes. The schema is `{'global':{name:value}, 'stages':{index:{name:value}}}`
- `hybridPlatform`: Name of hybrid-platform for communicating with LSF (can be None),
- `userMetadata`: A dictionary with `key(str): Any` value pairs that users can provide
- `instanceName`: The name of the directory containing the virtual experiment instance.
- `version`: The version of the st4sd orchestrator

## Retrieving the outputs of a virtual experiment instance

There are multiple ways to retrieve outputs of virtual experiments: via a virtual experiment interface, key-outputs, the Datastore APIs, and by leveraging ST4SD's automated upload to S3.

  <AnchorLink>Retrieving the properties measured by an experiment </AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Retrieving key-outputs</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Automatically uploading key-outputs to S3</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Listing outputs produced by virtual experiment components</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Retrieving outputs via the ST4SD Datastore APIs</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

### Retrieving the properties measured by an experiment 

Some virtual experiments define interfaces which make it simple for users to retrieve the input systems and measured properties from runs of that virtual experiment.

Learn how to use virtual experiment interfaces [here](/using-a-virtual-experiment-interface/#getting-the-properties).

### Retrieving key-outputs

Key-Outputs are files produced by an experiment that the developer has flagged as being of special interest. Since the names of the file can be generic the developer gives the key-output a descriptive label to better explain what it is. 

Information on the key-outputs of a virtual experiment instance are stored in the dictionary returned by `api_rest_uid_status` 

```python
status = api.api_rest_uid_status(restUID)
pprint.pprint(instance_status['outputs'])
```

An example of the output of this is

```python
{'OptimisationResults': {'creationtime': '1669584128.077387',
                         'description': '',
                         'filename': 'energies.csv',
                         'filepath': 'stages/stage1/ExtractEnergies/energies.csv',
                         'final': 'yes',
                         'production': 'yes',
                         'type': '',
                         'version': '1'}}
```

This says the experiment has one key-output called **OptimisationResults**. This refers to a file `energies.csv` produced by the component `ExtractEnergies` in the given experiment. 

To retrieve a key-output we can use `api_rest_uid_output`. This method returns the contents as bytes so it needs to be converted to a string. Note: replace `OptimisationResults` with the name of a key-output relevant to an experiment you have run.

```python
filename, contents = api.api_rest_uid_output(rest_uid, 'OptimisationResults')
contents = contents.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
# read it into a pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(contents), sep=",", skipinitialspace=True)
```



### Automatically uploading key-outputs to S3

ST4SD supports automatically uploading key-outputs to S3.
To enable this feature include the following values in the `payload` you provide to `api.api_experiment_start(experimentId, payload)`
(see [Running a virtual experiment](#running-a-virtual-experiment) for more information):

<InlineNotification>

See the [Cloud Object Store](/UsingCloudObjectStore) page for examples of getting the values to populate the `credentials` section.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification>

Note that `bucketPath` is optional and it defaults to `/`.

</InlineNotification>

The following example stores the key-outputs under `run1_output` in an bucket called`my-bucket`

```json
"s3Store":{
      "credentials": {
        "accessKeyID": "$S3_AccessKeyID",           
        "secretAccessKey": "$S3_SecretAccessKey",            
        "endpoint": "$S3_ENDPOINT",           
        "region": "$S3_Region",  
        "bucket": "my-bucket"
      },
      "bucketPath": "/run1_output/"
    },
```

### Listing outputs produced by virtual experiment components

Before being able to retrieve the contents of the outputs files produced by the virtual experiment components we need to know their paths.
We start by retrieving the list of components that were part of our experiment through these two calls:

```python
metadata = api.cdb_get_user_metadata_document_for_rest_uid(rest_uid)
components = api.cdb_get_document_component(instance=metadata['instance'])
```

The list of full paths of the output files produced by each components will then be available using the `files` key.
We can access it for component `0` as such:

```python
component_0_files=components[0]['files']
```

### Retrieving outputs via the ST4SD Datastore APIs

To retrieve outputs we use the `cdb_get_file_from_instance_uri` function.

<InlineNotification>

In this example we reference variables that we retrieved in the previous section ([Listing outputs produced by virtual experiment components](#listing-outputs-produced-by-virtual-experiment-components))

</InlineNotification>

This function, however, expects to receive relative paths instead of full ones. We can change our list of paths with this list comprehension:

```python
component_0_files_relative = [component_file[component_file.index('/stages/'):] for component_file in component_0_files]
```

Here we show how to retrieve the first file produced by component `0` from the previous example:

```python
data = api.cdb_get_file_from_instance_uri(document[0]['instance'], component_0_files_relative[0])
```



## Stopping a virtual experiment instance

The API call to cancel and delete a virtual experiment instance is `api_rest_uid_delete`.
Use this if you want to stop a run for any reason. 

The `api_rest_uid_delete()` method *does not affect the files* that the run has already generated. However, it does cause the run, and any components that are still running, to terminate. It also deletes any Kubernetes objects that have been created by the run.

You may also use this to delete Kubernetes objects created for running this virtual experiment instance. Note that deleting the virtual experiment instance **does not** affect the files that it has produced.

```python
# put here the rest_uid of the virtual experiment instance
rest_uid = "toxicity-predictions-trol7a"

api.api_rest_uid_delete(rest_uid)
```
