<PageDescription>

The `stp` command line tool simplifies common operations in ST4SD and performs
additional checks so you don't have to.

## Logging in to your ST4SD instance

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**NOTE:** `stp` supports multiple ST4SD instances at the same time.

</InlineNotification>

The easiest way to log into your ST4SD instance via `stp` is to use the snippet
in the Registry UI. If you're logged into your OpenShift cluster, you can paste
the following command in your terminal to automatically open the ST4SD Registry
UI:

```commandline
open "https://$(oc get route st4sd-authentication -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/registry-ui/"
```

Here you will:

1. Click on the **Login on stp** button
2. Press the copy button in the information box that you're presented with and
   paste the content of the information box in your terminal.
3. Once prompted, write `y` and press enter in your terminal to be brought to
   the authentication service.
4. Authenticate if needed and copy the token that is displayed.
5. Paste the token in the terminal and press enter. The login procedure should
   be completed soon.

### Creating a PVEP

To publish an experiment to our registry after
[writing a workflow](/workflow-specification), we need to create a
_Parameterised Virtual Experiment Package_ -or PVEP for short- that defines how
to run a virtual experiment in a particular way. `stp` can create a working
template for you with the `stp package create` command. Set the `--from` flag to
point to a git repository containing your experiment and optionally the
`--manifest` flag (in case your experiment has a manifest).

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-package-create.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Downloading a PVEP

`stp` helps us programmatically download a PVEP definition via the
`stp package download` command. If you're downloading a PVEP from a registry
that requires authentication, you can add the `--from-context` flag to ensure
`stp` can authenticate correctly.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-package-download.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Importing a PVEP

ST4SD provides a
[public registry of virtual experiments](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/)
that you can freely import from. To help you import PVEPs from any registry to
your own instance, `stp` provides the `stp package import` command. Make sure
you add the `--from-context` flag if you're importing from a private ST4SD
instance to ensure `stp` can authenticate correctly.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-package-import.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Pushing a PVEP

`stp` makes it easy for you to push PVEPs to registry instances, simply run
`stp package push` and give it the path to your PVEP for it to be added to the
registry from your active context.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-package-push.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Testing a PVEP

`stp` supports testing PVEP syntax locally before pushing them to the Registry.
Simply run `stp package test` and give it the path to the PVEP you want to test.
**NOTE: there will be no output in case of no errors**.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-package-test.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Updating a PVEP's definition

During development, you will likely make multiple commits to your repository,
and if you're following the
[best practices](/virtual-experiment-developer-best-practices) we wrote, this
will mean having to update the commit ID in your PVEP. For this, and for
modifying tags, `stp` offers the `stp package update-definition` command. Set
the path to the PVEP with the `--path` flag; then, the `--use-latest-commit`
flag will update the `commit` field to the HEAD of the local repository, while
by passing one or more `--tag` flags, you'll be able to set the tags of your
PVEP.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**NOTE:** for this command to work, the `--path` containing the PVEP must belong
to a git repository.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**NOTE:** by default, the PVEP will be overwritten, but you can pass a path to
the `--output` flag to change this behavior.

## Working with contexts

</AnchorLinks>

### Showing the active context

When working with multiple contexts in `stp`, it can be useful to check which
one we are currently using.

This can be done with:

```commandline
stp context show
```

Additionally, if you also want to see the URL that the context is for, you can
add the `--show-url` flag:

```commandline
stp context show --show-url
```

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-show.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Listing all the available contexts

To see all the contexts that are available for you in `stp`, you can use the
command:

```commandline
stp context list
```

As before, you can add the `--show-url` flag to also see the URLs the contexts
are for:

```commandline
stp context list --show-url
```

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-list.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Changing the active context

To change the active context (the one output by `stp context show`) you can use
the `stp context activate` command, passing it the name of one of the available
contexts:

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-activate.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Deleting a context

To remove a context and its associated credentials you can use the
`stp context delete` command, passing it the name of the context you want to
delete.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-delete.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Renaming a context

In case you don't like the name of one of the contexts, you can always rename it
via `stp context rename`, passing it the name of the context you want to rename
and setting the `--to` flag to the new name.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-rename.mp4"></Video>

## Working with stack-wide settings

</AnchorLinks>

### Listing available pull secrets

Not all images are available publicly, some may be private and require
authentication. When importing or pushing a package with `stp package import` or
`stp package push`, `stp` will check for you if an image pull secret is
available for the registries referenced by your PVEP and emit a warning if that
isn't the case. To see what image pull secrets are available to use in ST4SD,
you can use the `stp stack pull-secrets list` command.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-stack-pull-secrets-list.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Adding an image pull secret

If you are working with a private image registry, you will need to ensure ST4SD
has credentials to pull the images. To do so, you can use the
`stp stack pull-secrets add` command: set a name for the secret with the
`--name` flag, pass one or more registries URLs with the `--registry` flag, and
the username with `--username`. For the password/access token you have two
options: either passing it directly via the `-t` flag, or by writing it in a
file and using the `--token-file` flag (this will prevent leaking the credential
in your shell history).
