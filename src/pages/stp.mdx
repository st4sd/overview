## Prerequisites

- You are familiar with ST4SD terminology such as Virtual Experiment,
  Parameterised Virtual Experiment Package (PVEP), and Virtual Experiment
  Instance. You read about it [here](/concepts#terminology).
- Ensure you have correctly installed the ST4SD Runtime Core module
  (instructions [here](/#try-it-yourself)).

## Overview

`stp` allows you to log in and interact with multiple ST4SD instances,
simplifying many of the day-to-day tasks that virtual experiment developers
perform. This includes downloading, pushing, importing, creating, updating, and
syntax checking PVEPs.

## Logging in to your ST4SD instance

To interact with ST4SD instances using `stp`, we need to log in first. The
simplest method is to use the code snippet provided by the Registry UI. If
you're already logged into your OpenShift cluster, you can copy and paste the
following command into your terminal to open the ST4SD Registry UI
automatically:

```commandline
open "https://$(oc get route st4sd-authentication -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}")/registry-ui/"
```

Here you will:

1. Click on the **Login on stp** button
2. Press the copy button in the information box that you're presented with and
   paste the content of the information box in your terminal.
3. Once prompted, type `y` and press Enter to continue to the authentication
   service.
4. Authenticate if necessary and copy the token that is displayed.
5. Paste the token in the terminal and press Enter. The login process should now
   be complete.

## Downloading PVEPs

The ST4SD Registry allows users to easily access and explore _Parameterised
Virtual Experiment Packages_ (PVEPs) through a user-friendly web interface.
Through the interface, users can browse available experiments, view their
details, logs, and the results of their runs. Additionally, users can download
experiments by scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking the "Download
JSON" button. There may be instances, however, where they want to perform these
actions programmatically. With `stp` this is trivial: let us imagine we want to
download the
[band-gap-dft-gamess-us](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/band-gap-dft-gamess-us)
experiment that is available on our public registry.

We can simply copy the link and run:

```commandline
stp package download https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/band-gap-dft-gamess-us
```

For the experiment JSON to be downloaded to our currently active directory.

</Accordion>

## Pushing PVEPs

We need to add experiments to our Registry instance before we can view or run
them. To do this, we can either create a local PVEP definition from scratch or
download it from another instance (e.g., by using the `stp package download`
command). Once we have the definition, we can use `stp` to push it to our
registry.

Assuming our local file is called `nanopore-geometry-experiment.json` and is in
our current directory, we can run:

```commandline
stp package push nanopore-geometry-experiment.json
```

And `stp` will add it to our Registry instance.

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

## Importing PVEPs

In the previous sections, we learned how to download PVEPs and add them to our
Registry instance using the `download` and `push` commands. These commands are
versatile and can be used in various scenarios. However, if our goal is simply
to download a PVEP from an external instance and add it to our own, `stp` offers
another command, `import`, that can accomplish this task efficiently.

Copy the link to the experiment you want to import and run:

```commandline
stp package import https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/band-gap-dft-gamess-us
```

To automatically add it to your Registry instance.

## Creating PVEPs

_Parameterised Virtual Experiment Packages_ (PVEPs) are parameterisations of our
experiments that need to be created before they can be added the Registry to be
run or shared. `stp` can help getting started with this by generating a valid,
high-level PVEP that the user can later add details to.

<InlineNotification kind="info">

This feature requires for the experiment to be in a git repository.

</InlineNotification>

As we need a virtual experiment to test this feature, we will use the
[nanopore-geometry-experiment](https://github.com/st4sd/nanopore-geometry-experiment)
experiment as our starting point. Let us start by cloning it and `cd`-ing into
its directory:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/nanopore-geometry-experiment
cd nanopore-geometry-experiment
```

To create the PVEP we then need to run:

```commandline
stp package create --manifest manifest.yaml
```

The resulting PVEP can be pushed to the Registry using the
[`stp package push`](#pushing-pveps) command.

## Updating PVEP definitions

During the development phase of our virtual experiments, we will regularly
commit changes to the git repository.

If we are following the set of
[best practices](/virtual-experiment-developer-best-practices#strong-versioning)
we have defined, the commit ID will be included in our PVEP, ensuring ST4SD
executes the _exact_ version of our experiment, improving results
reproducibility. Provided is an example of how this might look like in your
PVEP:

```json
{
  "name": "nanopore-geometry-experiment",
  "source": {
    "git": {
      "location": {
        "url": "https://github.com/st4sd/nanopore-geometry-experiment",
        "commit": "85244f5c84d6c0e02aa7a2e1685b004cd0b3cdd2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, we might want to give a specific experiment version an
easy-to-remember name by means of a tag. `stp` makes updating the commit ID and
metadata tags of our PVEP as painless as possible by providing the
`update-definition` command. In the `nanopore-geometry-experiment` folder from
the previous example we can run:

```commandline
stp package update-definition --path nanopore-geometry-experiment.json \
        --use-latest-commit \
        --tag hello
```

The PVEP definition may now look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "base": {
    "packages": [
      {
        "name": "nanopore-geometry-experiment",
        "source": {
          "git": {
            "location": {
              "url": "https://github.com/st4sd/nanopore-geometry-experiment",
              "commit": "1682f979531ddef602440f0a3b146edb5916c001"
            }
          }
        },
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "package": {
      ...
      "tags": [
        "hello"
      ],
    }
  },
}
```

## Checking PVEP syntax

When we manually edit our PVEPs, we risk making mistakes. Fortunately, `stp`
includes a syntax checker that can help us identify and fix our errors. Let's
intentionally introduce a mistake into our `nanopore-geometry-experiment` PVEP,
which we obtained earlier in this tutorial, by adding a `nonexistent` field to
the `metadata` section.

Here's how the updated section now looks:

```json
"metadata": {
  "package": {
    "name": "nanopore-geometry-experiment",
    "tags": [],
    "license": "",
    "maintainer": "",
    "description": "",
    "nonexistent": true,
    "keywords": []
  }
},
```

`stp` will point us to the error when we run `stp package test`, as such:

```commandline
stp package test nanopore-geometry-experiment.json
Validation error in instance['metadata']['package']:
Additional properties are not allowed ('nonexistent' was unexpected)
```

## Managing multiple ST4SD instances

With `stp` it is possible to log in to multiple ST4SD instances - which we refer
to as _contexts_ - and quickly switch between them.

  <AnchorLink>Getting the currently active context</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Listing the available contexts</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Changing the active context</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Renaming a context</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Deleting a context</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

### Getting the currently active context

To see what the currently active context - meaning the ST4SD instance that `stp`
will run commands against - is, you can use the `stp context show` command. By
default, it will only print the name of the context, but an option is provided
to also print out the URL of the ST4SD instance for the context.

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="View video walkthrough">

<Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-show.mp4"></Video>

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

### Listing the available contexts

To see what instances you have logged in to, you can use the `stp context list`
command. By default, the results will be printed as a table but this can be
disabled with the `--simple` flag.

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="View video walkthrough">

<Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-list.mp4"></Video>

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

### Changing the active context

In case you need your commands to target a different `stp` context from the one
currently active (as shown by `stp context show`), you can use the
`stp context activate` command.

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="View video walkthrough">

<Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-activate.mp4"></Video>

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

### Renaming a context

If you created a context without specifying the `--context-name` flag, you might
have ended up with a context whose name is the full URL of the instance. You can
change this with `stp context rename`.

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="View video walkthrough">

<Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-context-rename.mp4"></Video>

  </AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

### Deleting a context

If you no longer need one of the existing contexts, you can remove it with
`stp context delete`.

## Advanced usage

`stp` offers some additional commands for more advanced useDebugValue, such as
interacting with stack-wide settings.

<AnchorLinks small>
  <AnchorLink>Listing available pull secrets</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Adding an image pull secret</AnchorLink>
</AnchorLinks>

### Listing available pull secrets

Not all images are available publicly, some may be private and require
authentication. When importing or pushing a package with `stp package import` or
`stp package push`, `stp` will check for you if an image pull secret is
available for the registries referenced by your PVEP and emit a warning if that
isn't the case. To see what image pull secrets are available to use in ST4SD,
you can use the `stp stack pull-secrets list` command.

<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>
  <Video src="../assets/videos/stp/stp-stack-pull-secrets-list.mp4"></Video>
</Column>

### Adding an image pull secret

If you are working with a private image registry, you will need to ensure ST4SD
has credentials to pull the images. To do so, you can use the
`stp stack pull-secrets add` command: set a name for the secret with the
`--name` flag, pass one or more registries URLs with the `--registry` flag, and
the username with `--username`. For the password/access token you have two
options: either passing it directly via the `-t` flag, or by writing it in a
file and using the `--token-file` flag (this will prevent leaking the credential
in your shell history).
