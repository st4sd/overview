This page will teach you how to write and run a workflow that uses application containers via a toy-example.
We advise users becoming familiar with the [component specification](/workflow-specification#component) before continuing.

[**ST4SD core**](/st4sd-core-getting-started) supports using application containers to execute component tasks.
Application containers enable developers to have reproducible experiments that they can share with their community.


## Using containers locally

Workflows can use `docker`-like runtimes (e.g. [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [podman](https://podman.io/))
for components which execute containerized applications.

Here is a minimal example:

```yaml
components:
- name: hello
  command:
    executable: python3
    arguments: -c "print('Hello world!')"
    expandArguments: none
  resourceManager:
    config:
      backend: docker
    docker:
      image: quay.io/fedora/python-311
```

Check out the [component specification](/workflow-specification#component) for the full schema of component definition.
By default, ST4SD will use `docker` to execute components whose `resourceManager.config.backend` is set to `docker`.
Use the `elaunch.py` parameter `--dockerExecutableOverride` to use a different `docker`-like backend.
For example, if the `$PATH` environment variable on your terminal is configured such that you can run the `podman`
executable you can use it for your `docker` components by setting `--dockerExecutableOverride=podman`.
If the executable is not in `$PATH` you can still use it, you just need to use the full path to it when you set
the value of the `--dockerExecutableOverride` parameter.


Additionally, ST4SD mounts the instance directory in containers it executes.
You may need to configure your container runtime system to have read/write access to the instance directory (e.g. by enabling read/write access to the parent directory of the workflow instance).


## Using containers on Kubernetes

Workflows which are running on a Kubernetes environment (e.g. [**ST4SD Cloud**](/st4sd-cloud-getting-started) on OpenShift)  can use the `kubernetes` backend to run containers.

Here is a minimal example:

```yaml
components:
- name: hello
  command:
    executable: python3
    arguments: -c "print('Hello world')"
    expandArguments: none
  resourceManager:
    config:
      backend: kubernetes
    kubernetes:
      image: quay.io/fedora/python-311
```

To run this, deploy [**ST4SD Cloud**](/st4sd-cloud-getting-started) then use the [Python client API](/running-workflows-on-openshift/) to execute the experiment.

## Using containers in multi-platform workflows

Often, workflows have support for multiple execution environments such as Cloud (e.g. Kubernetes/OpenShift), HPC, or even personal devices like laptops.
ST4SD uses the concept of [platforms](/workflow-specification#platforms) to help workflow developers define how their workflows should execute under different execution environments.
Typically developers use a [variable](/workflow-specification#variables) as the value of the field `resourceManager.config.backend`.
At execution time, a user configures the workflow to run using one of the available `platforms` by specifying the
`--platform` parameter to `elaunch.py`.
The components then use the appropriate backend for the desired `platform`.

For example, here is a single workflow that uses a backend based on the platform that the user decides at execution time:

 ```yaml
variables:
  # The "default" platform configures the component to use the "docker" backend
  default:
    global:
      backend: docker
      # All platforms inherit variables of "default" and may override their value
      image: quay.io/fedora/python-311
  # The k8s platform has the component use the "kubernetes" backend
  k8s:
    global:
      backend: kubernetes

components:
- name: hello
  command:
    executable: python3
    arguments: -c "print('Hello world')"
    expandArguments: none
  resourceManager:
    config:
      backend: "%(backend)s"
    docker:
      image: "%(image-python)s"
    kubernetes:
      image: "%(image-python)s"
```

To run this on a laptop, place the above in a file called `workflow.yaml`.

Next, `pip install "st4sd-runtime-core[develop]"` and then execute:

```bash
elaunch.py -l40 --platform default workflow.yaml
```
