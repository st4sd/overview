Just as the explosion of computational power, driven by Moore's Law, has enabled us to ask bigger and more meaningful questions, the complexity of the methodologies required to derive the answers has similarly spiked.  This has inevitably resulted in the ability to correctly deploy computational methods to derive value to become siloed into a relatively small number of individuals. 

The Simulation Toolkit for Scientific Discovery (ST4SD) simplifies the development, execution and dissemination of **virtual experiments** by providing powerful querying capabilities, robust and multi-environment execution support, AI acceleration capabilities, and a global showcase.

<Aside>

A **virtual experiment** is an application workflow which measures one or more characteristics of one or more input systems.
It is the computational analog of a lab experiment.

 We aim to enhance your simulation experience by providing:

- Enhanced **reproducibility** through, for example, the use of workflow and component registries
- Enhanced **productivity** through, for example, memoization of workflow sub-graphs
- Enhanced simulation **efficiency** through, for example, the enablement of hybrid surrogate-simulation workflows


The primary execution environment for ST4SD is OpenShift/Kubernetes, although executing on classic HPC e.g. LSF is also possible.

### Researchers

Researchers use ST4SD to run virtual experiments that have been made available to them.

<InlineNotification  kind="info">

Running a virtual experiment requires access to an instance of ST4SD. This means you need an URL to an ST4SD instance's REST API.

</InlineNotification>

<InlineNotification  kind="warning">

If you have do not have an URL contact the person responsible for the ST4SD instance or install and admin the stack yourself by going to [Administrator.](#administrators)

</InlineNotification>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="I have a URL and remote JupyterLab access">

- You're ready to go. Check [Remote JupyterLab or JupyterServer with OpenShift ST4SD Instance](/user-environments#remote-jupyterlab-or-jupyterserver-with-openshift-st4sd-instance) for some initial information.
- Then check [running workflows on OpenShift](/running-workflows-on-openshift)
- To access the same stack from Jupyter Notebook on your laptop see [Local JupyterServer with OpenShift ST4SD Instance](/user-environments#local-jupyterserver-with-openshift-st4sd-instance)

</Tab>

<Tab label="I only have a URL">

- You need to first [set up a local client](/installation#set-up-local-client)
- Once this is done check [Local JupyterServer with OpenShift ST4SD Instance](/user-environments#local-jupyterserver-with-openshift-st4sd-instance) for some initial information.

</Tab>

<Tab label="I also have an OpenShift cluster account">

- You can also [run workflows from your laptop terminal](/running-ve-via-terminal/)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Developers

Developers are researchers that also write virtual experiments. 

First, ensure you have access to ST4SD as described [here](#researchers). Then check [Orientation](/orientation) for a list of recommended initial developer docs. 

### Administrators

Adminstrators are responsible for spinning up an instance of ST4SD on OpenShift.
In most cases researchers and developers will not need to be administrators.
If you are considering installing ST4SD we recommend first checking that no existing instance is available for you to use.

If you need to install and administer your own OpenShift instance see the instructions [here](/installation#install-on-kubernetes-and-openshift).
This page also describes installing on classic LSF HPC cluster environment.

## Quick Taste

If you have `python3` with `virtualenv` installed (python 3.7 to 3.10 tested) you can quickly install everything you need to use run some example workflows locally. This will also enable you to use cloud-instances of ST4SD and to develop workflows locally later.

The following snippet will install `st4sd-runtime-core` and run a toy-workflow on your laptop

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 $HOME/st4sd-runtime-test
source $HOME/st4sd-runtime-test/bin/activate
pip install st4sd-runtime-core[deploy]
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers.git
elaunch.py --nostamp -l40 sum-numbers
```

This will create a new virtualenv called `st4sd-runtime-test` at `$HOME/st4sd-runtime-test` and install `st4sd-runtime-core` into it. It will also clone a repository into a directory called `sum-numbers` in whatever directory you run the above commands in. It will then run a toy-workflow that takes a couple of minutes to run. The toy workflow output will be in a directory called `sum-numbers.instance`

You can learn more about the toy-workflow, and workflow specification [here](/tutorial).
