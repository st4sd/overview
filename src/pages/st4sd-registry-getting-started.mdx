**ST4SD Registry** provides a web-based UI and command-line tool for working
with virtual experiments. The UI allows searching and inspecting virtual
experiment packages along with logs and results from when they were executed.
The command line tool simplifies creating, modifying and sharing virtual
experiment packages with colleagues or the wider community. Anyone can use ST4SD
Registry.

## Why ST4SD Registry?

The ST4SD Registry provides a powerful yet easy to use UI that enables both
novice and expert users to explore available virtual experiments, track their
runs, and inspect their outputs.

The `stp` command line tool provides a conversational-style interface that makes
it simple for developers to create and manage virtual experiment packages.

ST4SD Registry provides strong versioning capabilities by rigorously tracking
changes to virtual experiment packages. This enhances reproducibility which is
critical in scientific research.

## Try it yourself

Download a package from the ST4SD Global Registry via `stp`.

`pip install "st4sd-runtime-core[develop]">=2.4.0` then execute:

```bash
stp package download https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment
```

If you have an ST4SD Cloud instance, you can log in to your ST4SD Registry via
`stp` and push the package to it.

The first step is finding the URL to your ST4SD Cloud instance:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Use the oc command-line utility">

If you have the [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.18/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) command line utility installed, you can use it as follows:

<br />

```bash
: First, login to your OpenShift cluster
oc login ...

: Next, switch to the namespace that ST4SD Cloud is installed in
oc project your-project-name-here

: Finally, export the ST4SD_AUTH_URL environment variable for
: subsequent calls to stp
export ST4SD_AUTH_URL=$(oc get route st4sd-authentication -o=jsonpath={.spec.host})
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="Ask your cluster administrator">

To access ST4SD Cloud, you'll need the URL of the `st4sd-authentication` route. You can ask your cluster administrator for this information, as it's specific to your namespace. The default URL format is `https://my-st4sd.${your cluster ingress URL}`, where the cluster ingress domain is the base domain for exposing services on your cluster.

<br />

For example, if your cluster ingress URL is `apps.example.com`, the default URL would be `https://my-st4sd.apps.example.com`.

<br />

Then, export the `ST4SD_AUTH_URL` environment variable like so:

<br />

```bash
export ST4SD_AUTH_URL="the https:// URL that your cluster admin gives to you"
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Nex, you use the `stp` command to login to your ST4SD Cloud instance and push your package.

```bash
stp login $ST4SD_AUTH_URL
stp package push nanopore-geometry-experiment.json
```

Then visit the URL `stp` outputs to see the experiment in your ST4SD Registry
UI.
