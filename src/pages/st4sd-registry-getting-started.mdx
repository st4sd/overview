**ST4SD Registry** is a web-based UI and associated command-line tool for working
with virtual experiments. The UI allows researchers to search and inspect
virtual experiment packages along with logs and results from when they were
executed. The command line tool makes it simple to create, modify and share
virtual experiment packages with colleagues or the wider ST4SD community. Anyone
can use ST4SD Registry.

## Why ST4SD Registry?

The ST4SD Registry provides a powerful yet easy to use UI that enables both
novice and expert users to explore available virtual experiments, track their
runs, and inspect their outputs. Visit the
[ST4SD Global Registry](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/) for a first look.

    pictogram={<Tools />}>

The `stp` command line tool provides a conversational-style interface that makes
it trivial for developers to create and manage virtual experiment packages.

ST4SD Registry provides strong versioning capabilities by rigorously tracking
changes to virtual experiment packages. This enhances reproducibility which is
critical in scientific research.

## Try it yourself

Download a package from the
[ST4SD Global Registry](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/) via `stp`:

```bash
pip install st4sd-runtime-core
stp package download https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment
```

If you have ST4SD Cloud, you can also log in via `stp` and push the package to
your local Registry:

```bash
ST4SD_AUTHENTICATION_ROUTE=$(oc get route st4sd-authentication -o=jsonpath={.spec.host})
stp login $ST4SD_AUTHENTICATION_ROUTE
stp package push nanopore-geometry-experiment.json
```

Then visit the URL `stp` outputs to see the experiment in your ST4SD Registry
UI.
