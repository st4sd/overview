**ST4SD Registry** provides a web-based UI and command-line tool for working
with virtual experiments. The UI allows searching and inspecting
virtual experiment packages along with logs and results from when they were
executed. The command line tool simplifies creating, modifying and sharing
virtual experiment packages with colleagues or the wider community. Anyone
can use ST4SD Registry.

## Why ST4SD Registry?

The ST4SD Registry provides a powerful yet easy to use UI that enables both
novice and expert users to explore available virtual experiments, track their
runs, and inspect their outputs.

ST4SD Registry provides strong versioning capabilities by rigorously tracking
changes to virtual experiment packages. This enhances reproducibility which is
critical in scientific research.

## Try it yourself

Download a package from the ST4SD Global Registry via `stp`.

`pip install "st4sd-runtime-core[develop]"` then execute:

```bash
stp package download https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment
```

If you have an ST4SD Cloud instance, you can log in to your ST4SD Registry via `stp` and push the package to it:

```bash
ST4SD_AUTHENTICATION_ROUTE=$(oc get route st4sd-authentication -o=jsonpath={.spec.host})
stp login $ST4SD_AUTHENTICATION_ROUTE
stp package push nanopore-geometry-experiment.json
```

Then visit the URL `stp` outputs to see the experiment in your ST4SD Registry
UI.
