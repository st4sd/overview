## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have correctly installed the ST4SD Runtime Core module
  (instructions [here](/#try-it-yourself)).
- If you want to use the `import` or `push` commands, make sure you have logged
  into an ST4SD instance with `stp` (instructions
  [here](/stp#logging-in-to-your-st4sd-instance)).

## Downloading PVEPs

The ST4SD Registry allows users to easily access and explore Parameterised
Virtual Experiment Packages through a user-friendly web interface. Through the
interface, users can browse available experiments, view their details, logs, and
the results of their runs. Additionally, users can download experiments by
scrolling to the bottom of the page and clicking the "Download JSON" button.
However, there may be instances where they want to perform this action
programmatically. With `stp` this is trivial: let us imagine we want to download
the
[nanopore-geometry-experiment](https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment)
that is available on our public registry.

We can simply run:

```commandline
stp package download https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment
```

For the experiment JSON to be downloaded to our currently active directory.

## Pushing PVEPs

We need to add experiments to our Registry instance before we can view or run
them. To do this, we can either create a local PVEP definition from scratch or
download it from another instance (e.g., by using the `stp package download`
command). Once we have the definition, we can use `stp` to push it to our
registry.

Assuming our local file is called `nanopore-geometry-experiment.json` and is in
our current directory, we can run:

```commandline
stp package push nanopore-geometry-experiment.json
```

And `stp` will add it to our active context (you can learn more on contexts
[here](/stp#working-with-contexts)).

## Importing PVEPs

In the previous sections, we learned how to download PVEPs and add them to our
Registry instance using the `download` and `push` commands. These commands are
versatile and can be used in various scenarios. However, if our goal is simply
to download a PVEP from an external instance and add it to our own, `stp` offers
another command, `import`, that can accomplish this task efficiently.

Simply run:

```commandline
stp package import https://registry.st4sd.res.ibm.com/registry-ui/experiment/nanopore-geometry-experiment
```
