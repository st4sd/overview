A core-concept in ST4SD is a virtual experiment. This is a computational workflow that takes as input one or more systems of a given type, and produces as output values of `properties` of those systems.

This document descries how ST4SD developers can describe this information in their virtual experiments via an `interface`

The `interface` of a virtual experiment defines:

- The specification used to describe `input` systems it processes e.g. SMILEs for small molecules
- Instructions to extract the `input` systems from input data
- Instructions to extract the values of `properties` that the virtual experiment computes

Once a virtual experiment has an `interface`  ST4SD can return a `pandas.DataFrame`  containing the properties calculated by instances of the virtual experiment, as well as the ids of the `input` systems that an instance processed. This functionality is provided via the `st4sd-datastore` API and the `st4sd-runtime-service` API. See [using a virtual experiment interface](/using-a-virtual-experiment-interface) for further information. 

## Interface Definition

An `interface` is an optional top-level `FlowIR` key which describes what `input` and `properties` of a virtual experiment, as well as how to extract their values. 

<InlineNotification>

See the [tutorial](/tutorial) for a refresher on virtual experiment definitions and FlowIR.

</InlineNotification>

The general scheme of an `interface` is  

```yaml
interface:
  description: #A description of the virtual experiment. Optional
  inputSpec:
    namingScheme: #The scheme/specification used to define your inputs e.g. SMILES
    inputExtractionMethod: 
      $INPUT_EXTRACTION_METHOD_NAME: #The name of an input extraction method - see "Input Extraction Method" section for possibilities
        source:  #Optional source method used to provide input to the extraction method.. See the "Source Methods" section for potential values.
          ...
        args: #Optional arguments for the extraction method
          ...
  propertiesSpec: # A list of properties to extract
  - name: #The name of the property
    propertyExtractionMethod:
      $PROPERTY_EXTRACTION_METHOD_NAME: #The name of a property extraction method - see the "Property Extraction Method" section for possibilities
        source:  #Optional source method used to provide input to the extraction method. See the "Source Methods" section for potential values.
          ...
        args: #Optional arguments for the extraction method
          ...
```



The 2 main fields are:

- `interface.inputSpec`: A dictionary that describes the inputs of the virtual experiment and how to extract them
- `interface.propertiesSpec`: An array of dictionaries (one per `property`) that describes how to extract the values of the `property`

Within both fields the developer defines  extraction methods which tell ST4SD how to extract values that the virtual experiment reads (`input` ids) and writes (`property` values). 

- See [input extraction methods](#input-extraction-methods) for details on choices for that field
- See [property extraction methods](#property-extraction-methods) for details on choices for that field

Both input extraction methods and property extraction methods can have 2 sub-fields, `source` and `args` which may be optional.  If the `source` method is present it must be one of the options outlined in [source methods](#source-methods)


## Input Extraction Methods

Input extraction methods are used by to retrieve a list of the input system ids

### csvColumn

Use the `csvColumn` extraction method if the input ids of your experiment are defined in a column of an input CSV file **which has column headers**.

#### Options

```yaml
source:
  path: #The path SOURCE-METHOD. See source-methods for more
args:
  column: #The name of the column in the CSV file containing the ids (the column header)
```

#### Example

```YAML
interface:
  inputSpec:
    namingScheme: 'SMILES'
    inputExtractionMethod: 
      csvColumn:
        source:
          path: 'input/input_smiles.csv'
        args:
          column: "SMILES"
```





### hookGetInputIds

Use `hookGetInputIds` when you want to provide your own python function for getting the input ids.

<InlineNotification>

To use this method the developer must provide an implementation of the following python function and place it in a file called `interface.py` in the `hooks` directory of their virtual experiment. Note: this file can contain other functions also.

</InlineNotification>

```python
def get_input_ids(input_id_file: str, variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[str]:
   '''
       Params: 
            input_id_file (str): The path to the location of the file that contains input ids of the inputs systems. This comes from the `source.path` option in the interface YAML.
            variables (dict): A dictionary of the global and user variables passed to the virtual experiment instance
            
       Returns: 
            A list of strings each of which is the id of an input system
   '''
     pass
```

#### Options



```yaml
source:
  path: #A path relative to the root directory of the virtual experiment instance. It points to the CSV file that contains the `input-ids`.
```

#### Example



```yaml
interface:
  inputSpec:
    namingScheme: 'SMILES'
    inputExtractionMethod: 
      hookGetInputIds:
        source:
          path: 'input/input_smiles.csv'
```

<InlineNotification>

The [band-gap-gamess](https://github.com/st4sd/band-gap-gamess) virtual experiment uses `hookGetInputIds` to describe the extraction of input ids.

</InlineNotification>

## Property Extraction Methods

Property extraction methods conceptually produce a properties table which contains at least 2 columns: `(input-id, $propertyName)`where $propertyName is the name of the property in the `propertiesSpec` element using the extraction method. Note: in practice `propertyName` will be transformed to lowercase.

### csvDataFrame

Use this method if 

* there is a single CSV file to extract the values of a particular property from for all input
* The properties are stored in a column of this CSV file
* The input ids are stored in a column of this CSV file

**Note:**

The table created by this method must have column headers `input-id` and $PROPERTYNAME.  The `csvDataFrame` property extractor can change the column names to these correct values using the `renameColumns` option (see Example)

#### Options



```yaml
source:
   $SOURCE_METHOD_NAME # Name of the source methods and its options. See below. 
args:
   renameColumns: #Optional: Dictionary whose keys are column names in the CSV file and values are the names to rename the associated key columns. Output column names are implicitly converted to `lowercase`
   `${name}: ${value}`: #(Optional) Arguments to the `pandas.read_csv()` method. The default arguments are `engine="python"` and `sep=None`.
```

#### Example



```yaml
propertiesSpec:
- name: 'band-gap'
  propertyExtractionMethod:
    csvDataFrame:
      source:
        keyOutput: 'FinalEnergies'
      args:
        renameColumns:
          SMILE: "input-id"
        usecols:
        - "SMILE"
        - "band-gap"
```



### hookGetProperties

Use`hookGetProperties` when you want to provide your own python function for getting the property values. 

<InlineNotification>

To use this method the developer must provide an implementation of the following python function and place it in a file called `interface.py` in the `hooks` directory of their virtual experiment. Note: this file can contain other functions also.

</InlineNotification>

```python
def get_properties(property_name:str, property_output_file: str, input_id_file: str, variables: Dict[str, str]) -> pandas.DataFrame
   '''
       Params: 
            property_name (str): The name of the property the function should return the values of.  
            property_output_file (str): The path to the file containing the properties 
            input_id_file (str): The path to the file containing the input_ids
            variables (dict): A dictionary of the global and user variables passed to the virtual experiment instance
            
       Returns: 
            A `pandas.DataFrame` that contains at least 2 columns: `input-id`, `${propertyName}`. 
   '''
     pass
```

If `hookGetProperties` is defined as the propertyExtractionMethod for property `idx` the values passed to the parameters of this function are determined as follows

* `property_name` : The value of `interface.propertiesSpec[idx].name`
* `property_output_file`: The value returned by the`interface.propertiesSpec[idx].propertyExtractionMethod.hookGetProperties.source` method
* `input_id_file`:  The value of `interface.inputSpec.inputExtractionMethod.$METHOD.source`

Note: The column headers in the returned pandas DataFrame will be converted to lowercase by ST4SD. 

#### Options



```yaml
hookGetInputIds:
  source: #A source method - see below for details
```

#### Example


```yaml
propertiesSpec:
- name: 'band-gap'
  propertyExtractionMethod:
    hookGetProperties:
      source:
        keyOutput: 'FinalEnergies'
```

<InlineNotification>

The [band-gap-gamess](https://github.com/st4sd/band-gap-gamess) virtual experiment uses `hookGetProperties` to describe the extraction of properties.

</InlineNotification>

## Source methods

Source methods define different ways of defining a source file-path that is used by input or property extraction methods

### path

Use this method if you know the full path of the source file. 

#### Options



```YAML
path: $PATH #A path relative to the root directory of the virtual experiment instance. It points to the CSV file that contains the `input-ids`.
```

#### Example



```YAML
propertyExtractionMethod:
  hookGetProperties:
    source:
      path: "stages/stage1/EnergiesExtraction/energies.csv"
```



### keyOutput

Use this method if the properties are in a key-output of the experiment. This method avoids having to know the path to the file (which could change if storage methods change)

#### Options



```YAML
# The name of a key-output in the experiment.
# These are keys of the top-level FlowIR field `output`.
keyOutput: $KEYOUTPUT
```

#### Example



```YAML
propertyExtractionMethod:
  hookGetProperties:
    source:
      keyOutput: "FinalEnergies"
```



## Example

In this example we have a simple virtual experiment that counts vowels and letters in strings. Here is the FlowIR definition:

```yaml
output:
  vowels:
    data-in: stage0.count-vowels/vowels.csv:ref
  letters:
    data-in: stage0.count-letters/letters.csv:ref

components:
- name: count-vowels
  references:
  - input/words.csv:ref
  command:
    executable: bin/count_vowels.py
    arguments: input/words.csv:ref

- name: count-letters
  references:
  - input/words.csv:ref
  command:
    executable: bin/count_letters.py
    arguments: input/words.csv:ref
```

Here is an input `words.csv` file:

```
word;
hello;
awesome;
world;
```

When we process the above `input` file with this workflow we get 2 outputs:

The output `vowels` contains the CSV file:

```
a;e;i;o;u;word;vowels
0;1;0;1;0;hello;2
1;2;0;1;0;awesome;4
0;0;0;1;0;world;1
```

The output `letters` contains the CSV file:

```
word;letters
hello;5
awesome;7
world;5
```

### Interface

An interface to this experiment is shown below. This interface used `csvColumn` input extraction method and the `csvDataFrame` property extraction method. These methods mean the developer does not have to write any other code. 


```yaml
interface:
  description: Counts vowels in words
  inputSpec:
    namingScheme: words
    inputExtractionMethod:
      csvColumn:
        source:
          path: input/words.csv
        args:
          column: word
  propertiesSpec:
  - name: Vowels
    propertyExtractionMethod:
      csvDataFrame:
        source:
          keyOutput: vowels
        args:
          renameColumns:
            word: input-id
          usecols:
          - word
          - vowels
  - name: Letters
    propertyExtractionMethod:
      csvDataFrame:
        source:
          keyOutput: letters
        args:
          renameColumns:
            word: input-id
          usecols:
          - word
          - letters
```



### Run Details

Adding the `interface` definition will cause instances of the virtual experiment to generate 2 new files:

 - `${INSTANCE_DIR}/output/properties.csv`: This is a `;` delimited `CSV` file that contains the `properties` columns produced by each property defined in `propertySpec`.
 - `${INSTANCE_DIR}/outputs/input-ids.json`: A JSON file that contains an array of strings. Each string is the id of an input system.

For the above example we would get the following in  `${INSTANCE_DIR}/output/properties.csv`:

```
input-id;vowels;letters
hello;2;5
awesome;4;7
world;1;5
```

The input ids file (`${INSTANCE_DIR}/outputs/input-ids.json`) looks like this:

```json
[
    "hello",
    "awesome",
    "world"
]
```
