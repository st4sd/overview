ST4SD Core is a python framework for automating computational science workflows.
It enables researchers to create robust and reusable virtual experiments that can be deployed on HPC and cloud environments, or on their laptops

## Why ST4SD Core?

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Multi-platform deployment"
    background="true">

ST4SD Core provides features for writing virtual-experiments that can run on your laptop, on HPC machines, or on cloud.

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Analytics co-processing"
    background="true">

Run expensive analytics in parallel with simulations, ensuring they complete shortly after simulations themselves.
This also enables "on-the-fly" triggers based on the simulation behaviour, for example stopping criteria.

  </ExpressiveList>

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Simple specification"
    background="true">

We adopt a pattern of simple-specification, smart-runtime. 
Many execution details, for example data-transfer or restarting behaviour, are handled by ST4SD Core
eliminating complexity and enabling researchers to focus on the compuational process.

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Robust execution"
    background="true">

Features including image checking, image pinning, unstable filesystem identification and enhanced exit-code handling,
increase the chances that complex long-running workflow will complete successfully.

## Try it yourself

`pip install st4sd-runtime-core` and execute

```bash
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers.git
elaunch.py --nostamp -l40 sum-numbers
```

This will clone a  repository into a directory called `sum-numbers` in whatever directory you run the above commands in. 
It will then run a toy workflow whose output  will be in a directory called `sum-numbers.instance`.
The toy workflow takes a couple of minutes to execute
