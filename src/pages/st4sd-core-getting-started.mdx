**ST4SD Core** is a python framework for automating computational science workflows.
It enables researchers to create robust and reusable virtual experiments that can be deployed on HPC and cloud environments, or on their laptops.
Any researcher comfortable with programming can start using ST4SD Core.

## Why ST4SD Core?

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Multi-platform deployment"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<Build />}>

ST4SD Core provides features for writing virtual experiments that can run on your laptop, on HPC machines, or on cloud.

  </ExpressiveList>

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Analytics co-processing"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<Insights />}>

Run expensive analytics in parallel with simulations, ensuring they complete shortly after simulations themselves.
This also enables "on-the-fly" triggers based on the simulation behaviour, for example stopping criteria.

  </ExpressiveList>

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Simple specification"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<Documentation />}>

We adopt a pattern of simple-specification, smart-runtime. 
Many execution details, for example data-transfer or restarting behaviour, are handled by ST4SD Core
eliminating complexity and enabling researchers to focus on the computational process.

  </ExpressiveList>

  <ExpressiveList 
    title="Robust execution"
    background="true"
    pictogram={<Reliability />}>

Features including image checking, image pinning, unstable filesystem identification and enhanced exit-code handling,
increase the chances that complex long-running workflow will complete successfully.

    pictogram={<Reset />}
    >

Restarting long simulations due to hitting queue wall-times is very common in computational science.
The [restart documentation](/restart) describes ST4SD Core features for handling this.
