The Simulation Toolkit for Scientific Discovery (ST4SD) simplifies the development, execution and dissemination of **virtual experiments**.

<Aside>

A **virtual experiment** is an application workflow which measures one or more characteristics of one or more input systems.
It is the computational analog of a lab experiment.

## Run a Virtual Experiment Now!

If you have `python3` with `virtualenv` installed execute the following code to install `st4sd-runtime-core` and run a toy-workflow on your laptop

</Column>

python 3.7 to 3.10 tested

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 $HOME/st4sd-runtime-test
source $HOME/st4sd-runtime-test/bin/activate
pip install st4sd-runtime-core[deploy]
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers.git
elaunch.py --nostamp -l40 sum-numbers
```

This will create a new virtualenv called `st4sd-runtime-test` at `$HOME/st4sd-runtime-test` and install `st4sd-runtime-core` into it. It will also clone a repository into a directory called `sum-numbers` in whatever directory you run the above commands in. It will then run a toy-workflow that takes a couple of minutes to run. The toy workflow output will be in a directory called `sum-numbers.instance`
