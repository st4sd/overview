Our toy-example calculates the sum of a set of integers. It can be found [here](https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers/) or cloned via:

```
git clone https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers.git
```

Before we dive into the `sum-numbers` example, first we give brief introduction to key-concepts of the language used to specify workflows in ST4SD, FlowIR. 

## Introduction to FlowIR

We term the internal workflow specification language of ST4SD, `FlowIR`. FlowIR is a feature rich workflow definition language for describing the computational graph of a virtual experiment.

More detailed information on FlowIR elements can be found in [workflow specification](/workflow-specification) which also references the `sum-numbers` workflow for illustration purposes.

<InlineNotification>

In order to illustrate a wide-range of FlowIR features the sum-numbers example is slightly complex. The [hello world file](https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers/blob/main/hello_world.md) in the same repository contains a simpler `hello world` workflow.

### Components

In `FlowIR` a workflow consists of components. These are the steps in the workflow or the nodes/vertices in the workflow graph. A workflow may also define  [key-outputs](/workflow-specification/#key-outputs), and [an interface](/writing-a-virtual-experiment-interface).  An interface allows easy retrieval of the properties measured by an instance of a workflow (virtual experiment).

Each component is associated with a program or script and its command line arguments. A components inputs are files or directories. These come from other components in the workflow; or are provided by the user running the workflow; or are configuration files present in the workflow by default. Components produce their output under their working directory.

A component defines its inputs using a `FlowIR` object called a `DataReference`. The set of `DataReferences` between components in a workflow defines the edges of the workflow graph. 


#### An example component

Lets look at how the first component in the `sum-numbers` workflow, **GenerateInput**, is defined

```yaml
- stage: 0
  name: GenerateInput
  command:
    executable: "bin/generate_input_file.py"
    arguments: "%(numberOfPoints)s  %(my_random_seed)s"
```

### Stages

In FlowIR, components can be optionally grouped into stages by the value of their `stage` key. For the above component you can see it is `stage: 0`.

Components which do not specify a `stage` are automatically grouped under `stage` 0. In the interest of keeping this grouping simple we currently only support `integers` as stage identifiers. Components in the same stage must have different names. The `st4sd-runtime` also raises an error if a stage contains no components.

<InlineNotification>
Stages are a logical grouping. They do not define the execution order of components. A component is ready to execute once its input dependencies are satisfied. 
</InlineNotification>

### Component Identifier

The`identifier` of a component is a string built out of the `stage` and `name` fields of the component like so: `stage{stage index}.{component name}`.

The identifier of our simple example component would be `stage0.GenerateInput`

### DataReference

A`DataReference` points to

- data that exists before the workflow starts e.g. user provided inputs and configuration files
- data that are generated  by a component in the workflow



The format of a `DataReference` is

```
 <producer reference>[/<file reference>]:<type>
```

There are 3 parts: `producer reference`, an optional `file reference`, and finally `type`

The `producer reference` can be either:

1. A  full component identifier (e.g. `stage1.PartialSum`).
2. A relative component identifier (e.g. `ExtractRow`). Relative component references assume that the addressed component is in the same stage as the referrer component.
3. An absolute path.
4. A  path relative to the top-level directory of the workflow instance directory e.g. `bin`, `data`, and `input`.

<InlineNotification>

You define the directories that will be present in a workflow instance as part of writing the workflow - see [project types](/packaging-workflows).

</InlineNotification>

The `file reference`  is an optional relative path to a folder or file that's hosted under the producer i.e. in a directory or produced by a component. If this part of the `DataReference` is omitted the `st4sd-runtime-core` treats the  `DataReference` as a pointing to the directory of the producer.

The third part of a `DataReference` is its `method`. This controls what the `st4sd-runtime` will do with the reference. See [here](/workflow-specification#datareference) for more information.

<InlineNotification>

`st4sd-runtime` guarantees that at runtime a `DataReference` will point to the desired component data. However the exact location of that data can be determined by the runtime. This allows you to write a workflow that consumes data from other components without have to be concerned about how that data is stored. 

</InlineNotification>



#### DataReferences and Dependencies

`DataReferences`indicate the dependencies between components as well as dependencies of components to the filesystem. 

A component will not start executing until either:

1. The producers of its `DataReferences` have finished (sequential processing mode)
2.  The producers of its `DataReferences` have started (co-processing mode). 

The mode is defined by the component. 

#### Example

Let's look at an example `DataReference` and decompose it

```
stage0.GenerateInput/output.csv:ref
```

This `DataReference` points to the `output.csv` file (`/output.csv`) that the `stage0.GenerateInput` (producer identifier) component produces. The method is `ref` which means the `st4sd-runtime` will expand the `DataReference` to an absolute path to the referenced file. 

See the `references` section in the [description of basic FlowIR component fields section](/workflow-specification#description-of-basic-flowir-component-fields).



## The sum-numbers workflow

The workflow is defined in [conf/flowir_package.yaml](https://github.com/st4sd/sum-numbers/blob/main/conf/flowir_package.yaml) in the `sum-numbers` repository. In this toy workflow there are four components.

1. **GenerateInput**: The first step a single task generates a file with `N`  lines each with 10 space separated numbers.
2. **ExtractRow**: In the next step `N` tasks read this file in parallel and print 1 of the lines (from 1 to `N`).
3. **PartialSum**: In this step for each of the above tasks, another task reads their output, sums the numbers and print the result (`N` tasks total)
4. **Sum**: A final task aggregates all the partial sums, and prints the total sum.

The following sections show how to:

1. Write simple components in FlowIR.
2. Group components in stages and use `DataReferences` to define component input dependencies.
3. Specify inputs to workflows.


### Project structure

The ST4SD runtime supports two ways of structuring  workflow projects, `standard projects` and `standalone projects` - see [project types](/packaging-workflows). 

`sum-numbers` uses the `standalone project`  approach. In this project type, the workflow definition is stored under the `conf/flowir_package.yaml` file inside the root directory of the workflow project structure.

FlowIR supports defining a workflow package using multiple files by means of importing sub-workflow documents. However, for simplicity we omit this information from this toy example.

### Examining the `sum-numbers` components

 Component definitions are grouped under the top-level `components` field of the `flowir_package.yaml` file. The order of component definitions does define the execution order of the components - this is defined by the edges of the graph i.e. the `DataReferences` between the components.

In the snippet below we show the definition of 3 components, `stage1.ExtractRow`, `stage1.PartialSum`, and `stage2.Sum` from the `sum-numbers` example

```yaml
# ... omitted ...
components:
# ... omitted ...
- stage: 1
  name: ExtractRow
  command:
    executable: "bin/extract_row.py"
    arguments: "stage0.GenerateInput/output.csv:ref %(replica)s"
  references:
    - "stage0.GenerateInput/output.csv:ref"
  workflowAttributes:
    replicate: "%(numberOfPoints)s"

- stage: 1
  name: PartialSum
  command:
    executable: "bin/sum.py"
    # Eliding the stage<integer> prefix defaults to the stage of the referencing
    # component (PartialSum). Since ExtractRow is in the same stage with PartialSum:
    arguments: "ExtractRow:output"
  references:
  - "ExtractRow:output"

- stage: 2
  name: Sum
  command:
    executable: "bin/sum.py"
    arguments: "stage1.PartialSum:output %(addToSum)s"
  references:
    - "stage1.PartialSum:output"
  workflowAttributes:
    aggregate: True
# ... omitted ...
```

Let's focus on `stage1.ExtractRow` first. Its `command` field specifies the executable and arguments. The executable is a relative path (`bin/extract_row.py`) as it does not start with a `/` character. The `st4sd-runtime` interprets this to look for the `extract_row.py` executable under the `bin` folder of the workflow package definition. If the executable was an absolute path, or did not contain any `/` characters it'd be resolved using the `$PATH` environment variable of the `ExtractRow` component. See [environments](/workflow-specification#environments) for information on defining and using environment variables.

The arguments string of `stage1.ExtractRow` are `stage0.GenerateInput/output.csv:ref %(replica)s`. It consists of a `DataReference` (`stage0.GenerateInput/output.csv:ref`) and a variable reference (`%(replica)s`). The `DataReference` will resolve to the absolute path of the file `output.csv` which is produced by the `GenerateInput` component in stage `0`.

Notice that the `DataReference` is also part of the `references` array. All component references must be written in this array, otherwise the `st4sd-runtime` raises an invalid workflow package exception. This is primarily for error-checking. We also support more `DataReference` methods which cannot be a part of the `command.arguments` field. See the `references` section in the [description of basic FlowIR component fields section](/workflow-specification#description-of-basic-flowir-component-fields).

The variable reference `%(replica)s` instructs the `st4sd-runtime` to replace the reference with the value of the variable. See the [variables section](/workflow-specification#variables) more information about variables, and variable scope. In this particular instance, the `replica` variable is a special one. It is automatically generated by the `st4sd-runtime` for components which contain the `workflowAttributes.replicate` field. In this instance, the `st4sd-runtime` will generate `numberOfPoints` replicas of the `ExtractRow` component. Each of these replicas will have a `replica` variable with one value out of the integer range `[0, numberOfPoints)` (in this particular example the value range is `[0, 1, 2]`).

Next up is the `PartialSum` component. Notice its arguments `ExtractRow:output`. This is a DataReference with a relative-component-reference, so the `st4sd-runtime` understands that this is a reference to `stage1.ExtractRow`. However, recall that `stage1.ExtractRow` component is a replicated component. How does the `st4sd-runttime` pick, which of those components to reference here?

Because the `stage1.PartialSum` component does not contain a `workflowAttributes.aggregate` option, the `st4sd-runtime` will also replicate `PartialSum` the same number of times as its upstream replicated component (i.e. `stage1.ExtractRow`). It will then resolve the reference of replica `X` of `stage1.PartialSum` to the replica `X` of `stage1.ExtractRow`.

Component `stage2.Sum` is an example of an `aggregating` component. Aggregated components do not get replicated by the `st4sd-runtime`, they act as a sentinel node in the computational graph which stops the replication propagation.

The arguments of this component are `stage1.PartialSum:output %(addToSum)s`. The `st4sd-runtime` will first replace the `stage1.PartialSum:output` DataReference to multiple space separated DataReferences. One for each replica like so:`stage1.PartialSum0:output stage1.PartialSum1:output stage1.PartialSum2:output`. Right before the execution of the component, these DataRereferences to replicas will be expanded to the stdout contents of each of the 3 components.

## Providing inputs to workflows

ST4SD workflows support 3 flavours of inputs:

1. Input files - files user must provide when they execute the workflow
2. Data files - configuration files that optionally can be overridden
3. User variables - user provided values for workflow variables

### Input Files

Input files are the files you require a user to provide. You define them implicitly whenever you have a data-reference to a file in a top-level folder called `input/` i.e.

```
input/<filename>:<DataReference type>
```

You don't include input files in a workflow project. 
As a result for each data-reference to a file in `input/` you have in your worklfow configuration, the user *must* provide a matching input file when they launch the workflow.
For example if directly running the workflow they would use the `-i` option to `elaunch.py`.

When the workflow execution starts, `st4sd-runtime-core` creates the `input/` directory in the top-level of the workflow instance directory and copies the files the user provided for the inputs into this folder.
In this way the input files are where components expect them to be at runtime.

`st4sd-runtime-core` will check all required input files are present before starting the workflow and stop, raising an error, if they are not.


### Data files


Data files are configuration files users can optionally override. 
You define them implicitly whenever you have a data-reference to file in a top-level folder called `data/` i.e.

```
data/<filename>:<DataReference type>
```

You must provide defaults for these files. 
If you are using a [standard project structure](/packaging-workflows#standard-project) you do this by placing all the data files in a directory and then using a manifest to specify that this directory should be used as the data directory. 
For example, if you put all the data files in a directory called `shared_data` your manifest would look like: 
```
data: ../shared_data
```

If you are are using a [standalone project structure](/packaging-workflows#standalone-project) then the data-files are placed in the `data` folder of your project.

In the sum-numbers example the `stage3.Cat` component references one such data file:

```yaml
# ... omitted ...
components:
# ... omitted ...
- stage: 3
  name: Cat
  command:
    executable: "cat"
    arguments: "cat_me.txt"
  references:
    - "data/cat_me.txt:copy"
# ... omitted ...
```

In this example the `st4sd-runtime` will copy the file `$INSTANCE_DIR/data/cat_me.txt` into the working directory of the `stage3.Cat` file right before the component executes. 

The `st4sd-runtime` supports replacing files under the `data` folder via the `-d` option of `elaunch.py`. Keep in mind that the argument to `-d` must be the absolute, or relative, path to a file whose name matches one of the files under the `data` folder. If there's no `-d` option to override a `data` file, the `st4sd-runtime` will use the one provided by the workflow package to fulfil the DataReferences to it.


### Variables

Finally, the `st4sd-runtime` supports providing a file containing user defined variables via the `-a` commandline argument to the `elaunch.py` script. User variables overwrite global and stage variables but not variables defined by components. The schema of the file is:

```yaml
global: # dictionary of variables which are visible to all components
  name: some-primitive-value(str, float, int)
stages:
  stageIndex(integer): # dictionary of variables visible to components in stageIndex
    name: some-primitive-value(str, float, int)
```

User variables can be used to overwrite the behaviour of components (e.g. arguments or even FlowIR configuration fields). Here is an example user-variables file for this workflow which changes the number of replicas from 3 to just 1:

```yaml
global:
  numberOfPoints: 1
```

Currently, we expect that user variables are stored in a file with the extension `.yaml` OR `.yml`. The [variables section](/workflow-specification#variables) contains more information about variables and variable scopes.

## Key-Outputs

[Key-Outputs](/workflow-specification#key-outputs) are named `DataReferences` that point to important paths which the virtual experiment produced.

In sum-numbers there is only 1 key-output with the name `TotalSum`. It points to a file `out.stdout` that the `stage2.Sum` component produces.
This file contains the sum of all the numbers that this toy virtual experiment calculates.DataReferences

This is the relevant FlowIR snippet from sum-numbers:

```yaml
output:
  TotalSum:
    data-in: "stage2.Sum/out.stdout:copy"
```

## Executing `sum-numbers`

This section assumes that you've already installed [st4sd-runtime-core](/installation#set-up-local-client) locally and cloned `sum-numbers`. If you've installed `st4sd-runtime-core` in a virtual environment take a moment to load it before continuing.

To execute this workflow use `elaunch.py` (the script should take a couple of minutes to complete).

```bash
elaunch.py sum-numbers
```

An `instance directory` will be created in the directory you execute `elaunch.py`.  The instance directory will have the name `sum-numbers-<TIMESTAMP>.instance` (in the example below: `sum-numbers-2021-03-01T094529.183587`).

Each `sum-numbers` workflow component has its own working directory under the instance directory called: `$INSTANCE_DIR/stages/stage<stage_index:%d>/<component_name>/`.

 `elaunch.py` will output text that is similar to the following:

```bash
$ elaunch.py sum-numbers
