## Getting started

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Running and developing this website requires an up-to-date Node.js version. You can check what Node.js version you have currently installed with

```bash
node -v
```

Please refer to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it installed or if your installed version is older than 16.

#### Gatsby

This website is built using Gatsby. To get started, install the Gatsby CLI using:

```bash
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

## Development

### Installing dependencies

Install the dependencies for this project with:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Local development

Gatsby supports a local development mode with hot reload functionalities which makes it easy to preview the content you're creating. You can use it via

```bash
gatsby develop
```

## Production builds

As the website is served on GitHub from a sub-path, we need to use a flag when building with Gatsby to correctly support this.
This difference could sometimes lead to assets to not working as expected, and thus **it is strongly recommended** to build the website for production and test it locally before merging changes. This can be done with the following commands:

```bash
gatsby build --prefix-paths
gatsby serve --prefix-paths
```

The website will then be available at the sub-path configured in `gatsby-config.js`.
