## Context

This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts. 

## Decision 

This section describes our response to these forces. It uses full sentences, with active voice. "We will â€¦"

## Status

A decision's status may be "Proposed" if the project stakeholders haven't agreed wit it yet, or "Accepted" if they reached agreement. If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, we will change the status of the affected ADR "Superseded" with a reference to its replacement.


## Consequences

This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. It lists all consequences, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
